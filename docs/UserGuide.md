1. Download the latest `classmate.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/releases).
1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ClassMATE.
1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui-annotated.png)
1. Type the command in the **Command-Line Input** and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:
   * **`liststu`** : Lists all students.

   * **`addstu n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 c/G06`**: Adds a student named `John Doe` to ClassMATE.

   * **`deletestu 3`**: Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.
1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.


### Command Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addstu n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* You can add parameters in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, you can also type `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` for the parameters.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* If you add parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`), they will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
