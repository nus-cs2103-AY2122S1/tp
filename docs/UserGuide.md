Welcome to **Source Control** User Guide!

Source Control is a **desktop app for CS1101S professors to manage the performance of their students**.

This application allows you to **store comprehensive data** of each student quickly, and allows you to search through them easily.
With Source Control, you will never have to worry about your large student cohort and tracking numerous assessments!

Source Control can also give you both a quick overview and a closer look of how your students are performing.
This application **provides in-depth data analysis** of the performance of your students in each assessment,
giving you timely feedback on the pace and difficulty level of the module.

Source Control is **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Source Control can help you track your students' performance faster than traditional GUI apps!

This guide takes you through all the _latest features_ of Source Control. If you are a new user, this guide provides you
all the basic knowledge to [get started](#quick-start) with Source Control. If you are an experienced user,
feel free to skip to the [command summary](#command-summary) and experiment with our more [advanced features](#setting-customised-aliases-for-commands--alias)!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Features**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* `<angle brackets>`: <br>
  Words in `<angle brackets>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. in `addsudent -n <student_name>`, `<student_name>` is a placeholder which can be used as `addstudent -n John Doe`.

* `(round brackets)`: <br>
  Parameters in `(round brackets)` separated by `|` are mutually exclusive options for input. Only one input should to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. `(-n <student_name> | -i <student_id> | -group <group_name>)` can be used as `-n John Doe`, or as `-i E0123456`, or as `-g T02A`

* `[square brackets]`: <br>
  Parameters in `[square brackets]` are optional. <br>
  E.g. `-n <student_name> [-g <group_name>]` can be used as `-n John Doe -g T01A`, or as `-n John Doe`.

* `...​`: <br>
  Items with `...​`  after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  E.g. `[-g <group_name>]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), or `-g T01A -g R01A`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  E.g. if the command specifies `-n <student_name> -g <group_name>`, then `-g <group_name> -n <student_name>` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  E.g. if you specify `-g T02A -g T03B` and the command only expects one group, only `-g T03B` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  E.g. if the command specifies `clear 123`, it will be interpreted as `clear`.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


### Importing data : `import`

Loads data as specified in the provided CSV file.

Format: `import -f <file_path> [-g <number_of_group_columns>] [-a <number_of_assessment_columns>] [-t <number_of_tag_columns>]`

* The file path can be either the absolute path or the relative path. The relative path will be relative to the folder your JAR file is located.
* The first row of the CSV file needs to be headers for the respective columns.
* The header for the assessment columns should the name of the assessment. For example, `Rune Trials`. The header for every other column does not matter.
* Every row apart from the first represents a student.
* The first two columns should contain the student’s name and NUSNET ID.
* The next `<number_of_group_columns>` columns, should contain the student’s groups.
* The next `<number_of_assessment_columns>` columns, should contain the student’s grade in the respective assessments.
* The next `<number_of_tag_columns>` columns, should contain the student's tags.
* The number of group columns, assessment columns, and tag columns are assumed to be 0 if they are not specified.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes:**<br>

* `<number_of_group_columns>` refers to the number of **columns** the groups occupy in the CSV file, not the number of **types** of groups.
The similar applies for `<number_of_tag_columns>`.

* If the student does not have as many groups as the number of group columns, you should leave several group columns blank.

* If the student does not have a grade for some assessment, you should leave the corresponding assessment column blank.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

An example of how the CSV should be formatted is shown below:

![CsvFormatExample](images/UGExamples/importeg.png)

The command to import this file would be `import -f student_data.csv -g 2 -a 2 -t 2`.
(There are 2 group columns, 2 assessments columns, and 2 tag columns.)

Examples:
* `import -f /home/prof/CS1101S/student_data.csv -g 2 -a 10 -t 1`
  * imports from the absolute path, and database has 2 group columns, 10 assessments columns, and 1 tag column.
* `import -f student_data.csv -g 5 -a 20`
  * imports from the relative path, and database has 5 group columns and 20 assessments.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


### Accessing command history

Retrieves past command lines input.

* This can be done using the up and down arrow keys.
* Only successful command input would be recorded. Unsuccessful inputs which shows an error will not be saved.
* Using the up arrow key retrieves the previous input. 
* Using the down arrow key retrieves the next input.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


### Setting customised aliases for commands : `alias`

Sets up an alias that can be used instead of a command.

Format: `alias -c <existing_command> -as <alias>`

* `<existing_command>` refers to any command keywords e.g. `search`, `addalloc`, `addstudent`.
* The `<alias>` can only be a single alphanumeric word.
* Multiple aliases can be set for each command.
* Default and existing aliases can still be used after new alias is added. E.g. after `alias -c addstudent -as student`, both `student` and `addstudent` can be used.
* The `<existing_command>` can also take any existing alias as an input. The new alias will be added as an alternative to the default command.
* If you find that you have too many aliases, you can remove an alias by using `alias -c <alias> -as <same_alias>`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes:**<br>

* The aliases created will persist between Source Control sessions, as long as the application is in the same directory as it was previously.
* Default commands cannot be overwritten to perform different functionalities, and cannot be deleted.

</div>


Examples:
* `alias -c addstudent -as example`
  * adds a new alias to `addstudent` command.
  * `example -n Zhiying -i E1234567` will add student `Zhiying` to the database.
* `alias -c addgroup -as example`
  * replaces the mapping of the alias `example` to the `addgroup` command, i.e. `example` no longer function as `addstudent`.
  * `example -g T02A` will create a new group `T02A`.
* `alias -c example -as example2`
  * adds the alias `example2` to the command that `example` currently maps to, i.e. `example2` functions as `addgroup`.
* `alias -c example -as example`
  * removes the alias `example`. `example` will no longer be recognised as a command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing the data file

Source Control data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/sourcecontrol.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

If you are adding groups or assessments to a student, make sure you also add the groups to the groupList, and the assessments to the assessmentList. Otherwise, the changes you made could be lost!

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Source Control will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.

## **FAQ**

### Double-clicking isn't opening the app! What can I do?
Open your Command Prompt (Windows) or your Terminal (MacOS, Linux) and navigate to the folder your JAR file resides in.

Run the JAR file by using the command `java -jar sourceControl.jar`.

On an OS based off of Linux, it might be necessary to run `chmod +x sourceControl.jar` on Terminal to allow opening of the application via double-clicking.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


### How can I back up my data?
Source Control data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

If you wish to back up the data, you can use the `export` command to retrieve a CSV file containing the data. The `import` command can then load the data back into Source Control.

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


### Why is my data is gone when I reopen the app?
Please ensure that the JAR file is in the same directory as it was before. Our application stores the data in external files,
and data would be lost if either these files are deleted, or if the JAR file is removed from the directory.

Some of these data stored externally include students and their particulars (e.g. NUSNET IDs, groups, assessments and scores),
as well as you alias preferences.
