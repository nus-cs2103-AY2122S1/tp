# Introduction to Staff'd
## Overview
Staff’d is a **consolidated staff management platform** designed for **Food & Beverage store managers**, to aid them with the **management of staff details and schedules**. Staff'd is designed for stores with two shifts - a morning shift and afternoon shift, centrally supervised by one manager.

As former or present part-timers in the F&B industry, we understand that managers have a high administrative workload on top of their existing store duties. On top of that, any administrative mistakes or oversights can increase that workload exponentially. To address the aforementioned issues, Staff'd was designed as a consolidated staff management system which can **dramatically decrease administrative mistakes and workload**.

Staff'd is optimized for use via a [**Command Line Interface (CLI)**](#glossary):mag:, and is best suited for users who are adept at typing. A [**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**](#glossary):mag: is also available for ease of visualization and usage. For fast typists, Staff'd can **improve the efficiency of staff management and the ease of handling administrative duties**. After all, any task would be one [Command](#staffd-commands) away! Additionally, the usage of Staff'd requires **no former technical background**, and is **simple to learn**!

The purpose of this User Guide is to aid Staff'd users **optimize their utilizisation of the Staff'd application** and **improve their Staff'd experience**.

<br>

## Features Overview
### Staff Information Management
Staff'd aids with the **management of staff information**. The basic functions such as the [_adding_](#adding-a-staff--add), [_editing_](#editing-a-staff--edit), and [_deleting_](#deleting-a-staff--delete) of a staff member and their information are easy to implement. In addition, Staff'd supports the **management of additional information** such as their _status_ as a part-time or full-time worker, _salaries_, and [_roles in the store_](#glossary):mag:. Managers can also _tag_ the Staff members with short descriptions if desired. The information is consolidated and displayed in the Staff Tab of Staff'd as shown below.

### Staff Schedule Management
Staff'd also supports the management of **staff schedules**. [_Adding_](#adding-a-shift-to-a-staffs-schedule--addshift), [_swapping_](#swapping-shifts--swapshift), or [_deleting_](#deleting-a-shift-from-a-staff--deleteshift) a shift from a staff's schedule can easily be done. Staff'd consolidates these schedules and displays them in an intuitive manner in the Schedule Tab for ease fo reference, as shown below.

### Staff Salary Calculation
Staff'd supports **salary calculation of staff**. By inputting the salaries and shifts of each staff member, their salaries for the month can be calculated. Staff'd calculates [individual staff statistics](#viewing-individual-staff-statistics--istaff) as well as [overall statistics](#viewing-overall-staff-statistics--stats).

# Quick Start

## Firing up Staff'd

1. Ensure you have [Java 11](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest **staffd.jar** from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the [**home folder**](#glossary):mag: for your Staff’d.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. If there are any issues opening the file, refer to our [FAQ](#faq). Note how the app contains some sample data.

1. Opening the application creates a [**data folder**](#glossary):mag: inside the home folder. This will contained a **staffd.json** file which is the save file of Staff'd.

<br>

## Staff'd Commands
A Staff'd Command is an **instruction** that signals Staff’d to perform an operation. It consists of a [Command Word](#glossary):mag: and [Parameters](#glossary):mag:.
![CommandTextExample](images/CommandTextExample.png)![CommandTextExample2](images/CommandTextExample2.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:exclamation: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the **parameters to be supplied**.
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be replaced with a name, such as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in **square brackets** are **optional**.
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be inputted as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` can be used **multiple times**.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend` (i.e 1 times), `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be inputted in **any order**.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Parameters must be **inputted with a space** before them.
  e.g. `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` is accepted, but `addn/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` and `add n/NAMEp/PHONE_NUMBER` will not be accepted.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the **last occurrence** of the parameter will be used.
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be used.

* **Extra parameters will be ignored** for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`).
  e.g. If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Some parameters have additional conditions that must be met when inputted. More information can be found from the [Flag Legend](#flag-legend):triangular_flag_on_post:.

For instance, if a staff has an absent period from `2021-11-01` to `2021-11-07`, and `mark [staff] da/2021-11-06` is called, the absent period will be extended to be `2021-11-01` to `2021-11-12`.

# FAQ

**Q**: What do I do if double-clicking isn’t opening the app?
**A**: Open your [Command Prompt](#glossary):mag: (Windows) or your [Terminal](#glossary):mag: (MacOS, Linux) and navigate to the folder containing the **staff'd.jar** file. Run the file by using the command `java -jar staffd.jar`. On an Linux Operating System, it might be necessary to run `chmod +x staffd.jar` on Terminal so that double-clicking opens the application.

**Q**: Why is the staff information being truncated in the staff list?
**A**: The staff information exceeded the character limit of that field! To access the full information, the [`find` command](#finding-staff--find) can be used.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the save file that contains the data of your previous Staff'd.

**Q**: Where is the save file located?
**A**: In the [**data folder**](#glossary):mag: located in the [**home folder**](#glossary):mag: called **staffd.json**. The save file for the [**role requirements**](#glossary):mag: is also located in the data folder, and is called **RoleReq.txt**.
