## 1. Introduction

Fridgy is a **food and recipe management system**, for users to manage their ingredients and recipes easily.

Fridgy helps you track your ingredients and recipes. It also warns you about expiring and expired ingredients, and automatically deducts your ingredients when you cook recipes.

Fridgy is made for people living in shared spaces, since fridges can get *very messy* and difficult to keep track of!
It is a *desktop app*, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), with an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display ingredients and recipes! If you can type fast, Fridgy can get your fridge Inventory and Recipe Book sorted out faster than traditional GUI apps.

## 2. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `fridgy.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Fridgy.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. We've populated it with some sample ingredients and recipes for you to experiment with.

<br>
<i>When you first open Fridgy, it is filled with sample ingredients and recipes</i>
</div>

#### 2.1 Tutorial

Now that Fridgy is installed, you can test out the commands — add ingredients, recipes, and more!

Let us add our first ingredient:

`add ingredient -n Grapes -q 100g -e 25-10-2022 -d Seedless grapes`

This adds an ingredient named "Grapes", with a quantity of 100g, an expiry date of 25-10-2022, and a description of "Seedless grapes".

Then, add a recipe that uses that ingredient:

`add recipe -n Grape juice -i Grapes 50g -s Mash grapes -s Strain juice`

This adds a recipe named "Grape juice", which uses 50g of grapes, with two steps of preparation.

Finally, execute the recipe:

`cook recipe 1`

You would now have 50g of Grapes left.

Now that you are ready to use Fridgy, it is time to clear the sample entries and start adding your own:

`clear ingredient`, `clear recipe`

To exit Fridgy, type `exit`, or simply close the application window.
