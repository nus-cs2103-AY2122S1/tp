--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `tApp.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your tApp.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`students`** : Lists all students.

    * **`addStudent`**`n/Tom Lim e/tom@u.nus.edu s/A0123456B` : Adds a student named `Tom Lim` to the student list.

    * **`deleteStudent`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

    * **`clearStudents`** : Deletes all students.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addStudent n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/cs` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/year2`, `t/year2 t/cs` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME s/STUDENT_NUMBER`, `s/STUDENT_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `s/A0221393L s/A0114938H`, only `s/A0114938H` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `students`, `exit` and `clearStudents`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

## Students
### List all students: `students`

Shows a list of all students inputted into tApp together with their attendance and participation scores for tutorials.

Format: `students`

Examples:
* `students` returns a list of all students with their information and attendance scores

### Add a student : `addStudent`

Adds a student to the student list.

Format: `addStudent n/NAME e/EMAIL s/STUDENTNUMBER [u/GITHUB USERNAME] [r/REPO NAME] [t/TAG]…​`

* `NAME` should only contain alphabets and spaces.
* GitHub link will only be shown if both `GITHUB USERNAME` and `REPO NAME` are specified.
* `STUDENTNUMBER` must consist of a character, followed by 7 digits, followed by another character.
  Case of character does not matter.
* `EMAIL` must be of the form `local-part@domain` where
  * `local-part` should only contain alphanumeric characters and `+_.-`, and cannot start or end with `+_.-`.
  * `domain` is made up of `domain labels` separated by periods and must:
    - end with a `domain label` at least 2 characters long
    - have each `domain label` start and end with alphanumeric characters
    - have each `domain label` consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any
* If only either `GITHUB USERNAME` or `REPO NAME` are specified, the data will still be saved but not shown.
* If the same student is edited and the remaining empty data field is entered, a proper GitHub link will be shown.
* `TAG` has a character limit of 20 and must be alphanumeric with no spaces.

Examples:
* `addStudent n/John Doe e/johnd@u.nus.edu s/A0123456B u/user r/ip t/friends t/owesMoney` adds John Doe to the list
  and displays a confirmation output with a proper GitHub link
* `addStudent n/Bohn Doe e/bohnd@u.nus.edu s/A0123456C u/user` adds Bohn Doe to the list and displays a confirmation
  output without a proper GitHub link, but storing the `GITHUB USERNAME` in memory nonetheless.

### Edit a student : `editStudent`

Edits an existing student in the last displayed student list.

Format: `editStudent INDEX [n/NAME] [s/STUDENT_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [r/REPO_NAME] [u/USERNAME] [t/TAG]…​`

* You can remove all the student’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* This command flags out indexes less than 1 first, before missing fields, ensuring the validity of the fields, and finally the validity of index that is greater than 0. (If an invalid index greater than 0 is entered with no or wrong fields, the command would not check the validity of the index)

Examples:
* `editStudent 1 s/A0221111L e/johndoe@u.nus.edu` Edits the student number and email address of the 1st student to be `A0221111L` and `johndoe@u.nus.edu` respectively.

Examples:
