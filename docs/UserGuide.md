title: ModuLink - User Guide
---
## Welcome to ModuLink!

ModuLink is a **desktop-based** application for **Computer Science (CS) students** at NUS to facilitate finding teammates for group-based modules. With a powerful integrated contact management platform, connecting with peers to form project groups has never been easier. ModuLink allows you to find students taking the modules you are interested in, search by their group status (to find students available to form or join groups), and much more.
<br>

The app is configured to use the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, which means most of the commands you will interact with will be typed in a command box, rather than using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with graphical tools and icons. If you are unaccustomed to the CLI, do not worry, as ModuLink still provides a lot of the benefits of a GUI to make working with text-based inputs easy to understand.
<br>

This User Guide will show you everything you need to know to optimize your experience with ModuLink, whether you are a new or proficient user. We recommend reading through **[Section 1: Using this User Guide](#section-1-using-this-user-guide)** if you are a first-time user. If you would like to skip to the features ModuLink provides, you can head to **[Section 3: Features - Understanding what ModuLink can do for you](#section-3-features---understanding-what-modulink-can-do-for-you)**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 1: Using this User Guide
This guide has been designed to make sure you can quickly access any information you may need. At a glance, here is how it is structured:

1. [Quick Start - Getting started with ModuLink (Recommended for first-time users)](#section-2-quick-start---getting-started-with-modulink)
2. [Features - Understanding what ModuLink can do for you](#section-3-features---understanding-what-modulink-can-do-for-you)
3. [Managing Data](#section-4-data-storage-in-modulink)
4. [Summaries](#section-5-summaries)
5. [Frequently Asked Questions](#section-6-frequently-asked-questions)

We further recommend taking a glance at **[Section 1.1 Syntax and symbols](#section-11-syntax-and-symbols)** to familiarize yourself with the formats, icons and other terms this guide uses.

### Section 1.1: Syntax and Symbols
Here are the commonly used syntax and symbols throughout the UG:

`inline code`<br/>denotes a command for the application.<br>
`prefix/` <br/> denotes a ModuLink-supported prefix.

<div class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: Important</div>denotes an important information for the functioning of the app.
<br/>

<div class="alert alert-warning">:warning: Caution</div>denotes a possible fault that could occur.
<br/>

## Section 2: Quick Start - Getting Started with ModuLink

### Section 2.1 One-time Set-Up
If you are using ModuLink for the first time, we will first walk you through a one-time set-up to get started.

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed on your computer. You can easily do this via the **Terminal** app for Mac users, or the **Command Prompt** app for Windows users, and simply type and enter `java -version`. 
<br/>
Alternatively, if you prefer, you could also check the version via the GUI for both Mac and Windows systems, as mentioned in this [guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/check-java-version-on-mac-windows). 
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: Important:
   ModuLink will not run on older versions of Java! If you do not have Java 11 installed, please install it by following the instructions in the official [guide](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).
   </div>
   <br/>
2. Download the latest **ModuLink.jar** from our website [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/releases).
3. Move the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for ModuLink on your computer.

### Section 2.2 Working with ModuLink
To run the app, simply double click the file. 

Alternatively, you can open the app via the **Terminal** app for Mac users, or the **Command Prompt** app for Windows users. To do this,
1. `cd` into the directory you saved ModuLink in.
2. Type and enter `java -jar ModuLink.jar`.

You should see a GUI similar to the one shown below in a few seconds. The app will already contain data. Here’s a quick look at the different elements in the app.

![Ui](images/screenshots/Ui2.png)

As mentioned earlier, ModuLink works as a CLI, which means you will need to type and enter commands in the command box. To get accustomed to the interface, try the following commands (in the given the order).

* **`create n/John Doe id/A0123456A p/24680135 e/johndoe@example.com`** : Creates your ModuLink user profile with the name John Doe and the relevant student ID, phone number and email.
* **`addMod mod/CS2103T need group`**, followed by **`addMod mod/CS2101 need member`**: Adds CS2103T and CS2101 module tags to your profile and indicates that you need to form or join a group for CS2103T and that you need member(s) for your CS2101 group.
* **`list`**: Lists all the profiles on ModuLink.
* **`filter mod/CS2101`**: Filters all profiles who have CS2101 as one of their module tags.
* **`filter mod/CS2101 need group`**: Filters all profiles who have CS2101 as one of their module tags AND need to form or join a group for it.
* **`addFav A1234567R`**: Adds the profile with the student ID A1234567R to your favorites list.
* **`listFav`**: Lists all your favorite profiles.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
  
* Prefixes and commands are case-sensitive.<br>

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [mod/MODULE]` can be used as `n/John Doe mod/CS2103T` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[mod/MODULE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `mod/CS2100`, `mod/CS2100 mod/CS2103T` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
