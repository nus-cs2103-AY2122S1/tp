## FAQ

This section contains some frequently asked questions about SPAM.

<div class="card mb-3">
<div markdown="1" class="card-body pt-0 pb-0">
<h6 markdown="1" class="card-title">How do I transfer my data to another computer?</h6>

**Option 1:**
Export all the contacts on your current device into a _.csv_ file. Then, after installing the app in your new device,
import the _.csv_ file into the new list of contacts.

**Option 2 (with encryption):**
Move the encrypted file from the application's data folder in your current device to the application's data folder in 
your new device. Start the application and then enter the same password when prompted. 
</div>
</div>

<div class="card mb-3">
<div markdown="1" class="card-body pt-0 pb-0">
<h6 markdown="1" class="card-title">Help, I have forgotten my password!</h6>
Unfortunately, there is no way to reset the password. To continue using the application, you need to move the encrypted 
data file (located at `[location of SPAM.jar]/data/addressbook.enc`) to a different location or delete it. The 
application will create a fresh data set for you to start over with.

The good news is, the data file stays encrypted and secure regardless! If you suddenly remembered the password you used
to encrypt the data, just move the data file back to the original directory and restart the application.
