## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest `advyze.jar` release from [this link](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-4/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Advyze.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. You should see the Dashboard tab displayed (refer to the [Dashboard Tab](#dashboard-tab) section to see how it is supposed to look like).
5. At this point, you are good to go! You can now begin running the commands detailed in this guide for any of the tabs.

## Using This Guide

This guide is sectioned by tabs. Under the sections for each tab, the reader will find information regarding the commands that can be ran on that tab specifically, as well as a brief description of the intended purpose of the tab. In addition, there is a general section that explains commands that are not tab specific, and can be ran while on any tab.

> :exclamation: Note: 
>
> The commands described in the various tab-specific sections (Dashboard tab, Todos tab etc) are only meant to run as intended when the user is on the correct tab. This means that if some command X with effect Y is specified in the 'Z tab' section, the user will only get intended effect Y when X is executed *when on the Z tab* (unless the user uses [convenience commands](#convenience-commands), or if it is the Contacts and Details tabs which are highly related, see [summary of commands for contacts and details tab](#summary-of-commands-for-contacts-and-details-tab)). For example, the command to mark a todo as done will work only while the user is on the Todos tab.
>
> It is hence implied that any command in the tab-specific sections describes the behaviour when running that command when on that tab in particular.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

-   Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
    e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

-   Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

-   Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
    e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

-   Parameters can be in any order.<br>
    e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

-   If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
    e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

-   Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
    e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

## General Commands

> :exclamation: All the commands in this section can be ran while on any tab.

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Switching between tabs: `tab`

Switches between different tabs.

Format: `tab TAB_NAME`

> :bulb: Tip: the various `TAB_NAME`s are:
>
> * dashboard
> * contacts
> * details
> * schedule
> * todos

Examples:
* `tab dashboard` while on the Contacts tab changes to the Dashboard tab
* `tab contacts` while on the Contacts tab has no effect – the user just remains on the Contacts tab

### Convenience commands

To prevent extra tab switches in order to execute commands, convenience commands allows users to execute commands meant for some other tab regardless of which tab they are currently on.

Format: `/TAB NAME [command meant to run on TAB_NAME tab] `

(see the :bulb: tip under the [Switching between Tabs](#switching-between-tabs-tab) section above for the various `TAB_NAME`s)

Examples:
* When on Todos tab, entering `/schedule add d/CS2103 Meeting date/20-12-2021 fr/1300 to/1500` will add a new event (akin to executing the `add` command on the Schedule tab) instead of adding a new todo.
* When on the Dashboard tab, entering `/schedule delete 2` will remove the event at index `2` on the Schedule tab.
* When on the Schedule tab, entering `/schedule delete 2` and `delete 2` produces the same effect, removing the event at index `2` on the Schedule tab.

### Importing .ics files for schedule: `import`

Allows users to import `.ics` files, similar to importing timetable from NUSMods into Google Calendars.

Format: `import`

Example:
* On any tab, executing `import` will open the file browser for the user to select the `.ics` file to import.

### Exiting the application: `exit`

Terminates the application.

Format: `exit`

## Dashboard Tab
The Dashboard tab is the default landing page of the app. It displays a summary of relevant information from the other sections of the app in addition to having some features of its own.
* The Dashboard tab by default has 4 sections:
  * The analytics for contacts, which is automatically updated as the user populates the app with data (top left)
  * The user's custom goals, which they can add and update (top right)
  * The user's schedule in chronological order (which is synced with information in the Schedule tab) (middle)
  * The user's todos, with the earliest added at the top (which is synced with the information in the Todos tab) (bottom)
* The latter two sections are automatically updated as the data in the respective tabs are changed.
* The user can adjust how much of each section is to be displayed by sliding the black bars up and down or left and right as required.

This is how the Dashboard tab looks like as of v1.4: 

![dashboard_tab](images/dashboard-tab-v1.4.png)

### Analytics
The analytics section is the section at the top left of the Dashboard tab, directly below the Dashboard button. This feature provides some analytics for the user's contacts, specifically counting the number of clients with the various `status` (whether they are fresh leads, approached, closed, etc).

The tracking is by quarters of the year, e.g. if the current quarter is Q3, the analytics will only show fresh leads *for Q3*, clients approached *in Q3*, etc.

This section is automatically updated as the status of the various contacts change in the contacts list. For more details about the various client statuses, see the [section on statuses](#changing-a-clients-status-status) below.


### Custom Goals
As a financial advisor, they might want to set a target for and subsequently work towards things like:
* The amount of commission earned in the current month/quarter
* The number of new clients called today  

Essentially, this feature set is meant for users to track anything that is quantifiable that they want to track. Every custom goal will *minimally* have a description, a goal value, and a progress value, the former 2 which have to be specified by the user at the point of addition, with the progress value being set by default to 0.

To better understand how this is meant to be useful, if the user, for example, has a goal to call at least 20 new clients by the end of this week:
1. They would first `add` that goal, with the description being something like "call 20 clients", the goal being "20", and the end date the date of the last day of this week
2. Every time they make a new call, they would `update` the progress of that custom goal they created in step 1 by a value of 1
3. The progress bar in between the progress and goal columns gives the user a quick visual indication of how much they have accomplished / have yet to accomplish
4. Once they have hit their goal, i.e. progress >= 20 in this example, the value in the progress column would turn green as a visual indication of completion
5. If it is past the end of the week and progress < 20, the value in the end date and end time columns will turn red
6. Once the user has no need to track the goal anymore, they can `delete` it to de-clutter the space

See the subsequent sections to find out how the user could go about doing these.


#### Adding a custom goal: `add`
Adds a new custom goal. The progress of the custom goal will be set to 0 by default.

Format: `add d/DESCRIPTION goal/GOAL [bydate/END_DATE] [bytime/END_TIME]`  

* `GOAL` has to be a number (greater than 0)
* `END_DATE` has to be in the format dd-mm-yyyy and `END_TIME` has to have the format hhmm in 24-hour format
*  If `END_TIME` is specified, `END_DATE` has to be specified as well

Examples:
* Adding a goal with a date but no time: `add d/call 20 clients goal/20 bydate/16-05-2022`
* Adding a goal with both a date and time: `add d/earn $1000 in commissions goal/1000 bydate/23-07-2022 bytime/1200`

> :exclamation: Note: currently there is no command to edit custom goals; if the user, for example, commits a typo when creating a custom goal, they have to delete the custom goal and repeat the adding process with the correct information.

#### Updating the progress of a custom goal: `update`

Updates *the progress* of a particular custom goal by the specified value, i.e. updated progress = old progress + `AMOUNT_TO_INCREMENT_GOAL_BY`

Format: `update INDEX_OF_CUSTOM_GOAL val/AMOUNT_TO_INCREMENT_GOAL_BY`

* `AMOUNT_TO_INCREMENT_GOAL_BY` has to be a number (can be positive or negative)

Example: 
* To update progress of custom goal 1 by an amount of 123.4: `update 1 val/123.4`

> :bulb: Tip: since the update command allows the user to enter negative values, if they, for example, enter a wrong (positive) value for progress, they can correct it by updating the same goal with the difference, e.g. if the intended amount was to add 5 to progress but the user specified 7, they can just correct this by updating the same goal and specifying val = -2.

#### Deleting a custom goal: `delete`
Deletes the specified custom goal from the Dashboard.  

Format: `delete INDEX_OF_GOAL_TO_DELETE` 

* `INDEX_OF_GOAL_TO_DELETE` has to be a valid index

## Contacts Tab

This tab contains all the user's added contacts along with the contacts' information.

Statuses look like tags but have a dark blue background, as show in the image above.

The valid statuses are: [fresh, approached, pitched, negotiated, closed]

* New contacts created in the contacts list are given a "fresh" status to signify that the client is a fresh lead
* The total number of clients with a particular status is shown in the [analytics](#analytics) section of the Dashboard tab
* Friends do not have statuses

Format: `status INDEX STATUS`  

* Index is the index of the contact to change the status of
* Status is the new status to change to

Examples of changing status:
* Change status of contact 1 to "approached": `status 1 approached`
* Change status of contact 2 to "negotiated": `status 2 negotiated`
