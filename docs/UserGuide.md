TutorAid is a **desktop app for private tutors to match their students' contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TutorAid
can get your student management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user and can contain spaces.
e.g. in `add sn/STUDENT_NAME`, `STUDENT_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as add n/John Doe.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
e.g `sn/STUDENT_NAME [sp/STUDENT_PHONE]` can be used as `sn/John Doe sp/91234567` or as `sn/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.
e.g. if the command specifies `sn/STUDENT_NAME sp/STUDENT_PHONE`, `sp/STUDENT_PHONE sn/STUDENT_NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but if you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
e.g. if you specify `p/92341234 p/86785678`, only `p/86785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
