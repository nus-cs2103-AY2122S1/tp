# AniList V1.4

AniList is a desktop application made to be a single centralized location for anime lovers to keep track of all the animes they are interested in. With AniList, users are able to keep track of animes that they are watching, want to watch, and finished watching. Users are also able to get statistics on their watching habits such as the genre distribution of their current list of animes.

AniList is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a customizable Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a fast typist, AniList can get your anime management tasks done FASTER than traditional GUI applications!

This User Guide is to be used by any AniList user. No technical background is required.

## Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about command format:**
* Words in UPPER_CASE are the specifications given by the user:
  <br/>e.g. in `add n/NAME`, NAME is the specification which can be used in the form `add n/Doraemon`

* Items in square brackets are optional:
  <br/>e.g. `add n/NAME [e/EPISODE]`. Both `add n/Naruto` and `add n/Naruto e/27` are considered valid commands
