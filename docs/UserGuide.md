CONNECTIONS is a **desktop app for managing contacts and keeping tracks of birthdays, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CONNECTIONS can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.

1. Download the latest `CONNECTIONS.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home directory_ for your CONNECTIONS.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will show a list of commands that CONNECTIONS supports.<br>
   Click [here](#command-summary) for a summary of example commands you can try!

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. `list 123` will be interpreted as `list`.

* Phone numbers can be of any length, but can only contain numerical digits.

* Command words are case-sensitive. e.g. `findany` will not be interpreted as `findAny`.

</div>

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Upcoming Birthdays
The vertical tab provides upcoming birthdays at a glance. Having this means that you will never miss a birthday.
It sorts all birthdays amongst all contacts in CONNECTIONS **chronologically**, with the **nearest** upcoming birthday at the **top**.

* Contacts color-coded in **GREEN** are celebrating their birthdays **today**.
* Contacts color-coded in **BLUE** will be celebrating their birthdays in **a week or less**.
* The rest of the entries will not be color-coded.

#### Format:
* `list`

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Editing a contact : `edit`

Edits an existing contact in CONNECTIONS.

#### Format:
* `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [b/BIRTHDAY] [t/TAG]…​`

Notes:
* Edits the contact at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* There must be at least one of the optional fields provided alongside the edit command.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* The existing set of tags that belongs to a contact will be updated to the new set of tags inputted. i.e. The edits made to a set of tags are not cumulative.
* You can remove all tags of a particular contact using `edit INDEX t/` (without providing anything after `t/`).


**Sample Usage:**

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Adding Tags : `tag`

Adds one or more tags to an existing contact in CONNECTIONS. This facilitates the organization of contacts into groups.

#### Format:
* `tag INDEX t/TAG [t/MORE_TAGS]…​`

Notes:
* Adds tag(s) to the contact at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* New tags are added on top of existing tags i.e., tags added are cumulative.
* Adding new tags which already exist will succeed with a warning letting you know that the contact already had those tags.
* Tags have a character limit of 60.

**Sample Usage:**
* `tag 2 t/friend t/NUS`
    * Adds the tags `friend` and `NUS` to the 2nd contact.

### Removing Tags : `untag`

Notes:
* Remove tags from the contact at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Only tags that exist will be removed.
* CONNECTIONS displays a warning and will not remove any tags if the user tries to remove a non-existent tag.

**Sample Usage:**
* `untag 2 t/friend t/NUS`
    * Removes the tags `friend` and `NUS` from the 2nd contact.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Locating contacts by name(s) and tag(s): `find`

Finds all contacts who match **ALL** name and tag keywords provided.
This narrows your search so that you will be able to filter contacts with greater specificity.

The commands `find` and `findAny` will filter the displayed contacts and only display the matching results.  
![result for `find n/alex t/football t/classmate`](images/findAlexfootballclassmatesResult.png)

#### Format:
* `find [c/] [n/NAME] …​ [t/TAG] …​`
  * Note that `find` must have at least one `[n/NAME]` or `[t/TAG]`.

Notes:  
* `find` is case-insensitive for names. e.g. `find n/hans` will match contacts named `Hans`.  
* `find` is case-insensitive for tags by default. e.g. `find t/friend` will match a contact with tags `Friend` or `friend`.  
  * Adding the `c/` flag **after** the command word will make tag matching case-sensitive.  
    e.g. `find c/ t/friend` will match a contact with tag `friend` but not `Friend`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `find n/Hans t/football` will return the same result as `find  t/football n/Hans`.
* Only full words will be matched for names and tags.  
  * `find n/an` will not return `Hans`, but will return `Jing An`.  
* Only contacts that matched all keywords provided will be returned as search results (i.e. `AND` search).  
  e.g. `find n/Hans t/Friend` will return all contacts with names containing the word `Hans` and are tagged with `Friend`.

**Sample Usage:**
* `find n/John`
  * returns `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find n/alex t/football t/classmate`
  * returns `Alex Yeoh`, who has both `football` and `classmates` tag.<br>
* `find c/ t/FRIENDS`
  * returns `Shin`, who is tagged with `FRIENDS`.

### Locating contacts by name(s) or tag(s): `findAny`

Finds all contacts who match **ANY** name and tag keywords provided. 
This broadens your search so that you will be able to filter contacts with greater flexibility.

#### Format:
* `findAny [c/] [n/NAME] …​ [t/TAG] …​`
  * Note that `findAny` must have at least one `[n/NAME]` or `[t/TAG]`.

Notes:
* `findAny` is case-insensitive for names. e.g. `findAny n/hans` will match contacts named `Hans`.
* `findAny` is case-insensitive for tags by default. e.g. `findAny t/friend` will match a contact with tags `Friend` or `friend`.
  * Adding the `c/` flag **after** the command word will make tag matching case-sensitive.  
    e.g. `findAny c/ t/friend` will match a contact with tag `friend` but not `Friend`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `findAny n/Hans t/football` will return the same result as `findAny t/football n/Hans`.
* Only full words will be matched for names and tags.
  * `findAny n/an` will not return `Hans`, but will return `Jing An`.
* Only contacts that match at least one of the keywords provided will be returned as search results (i.e., `OR` search)
  e.g. `findAny n/Hans t/Friend` will return all contacts with names containing the word `Hans` or are tagged with `Friend`.


**Sample Usage:**
* `findAny n/John`
  * returns `john` and `John Doe`.
* `findAny n/alex n/irfan t/chef`
  * returns `Alex Yeoh`, `Irfan Ibrahim`, `Carol` who is tagged with `chef`.<br>
* `findAny c/ n/Shin t/FRIENDS t/chef`
  * returns `Shin` who is tagged with `FRIENDS`, as well as `Carol` who is tagged with `chef`.

#### Format: 
* `pin INDEX`
