## Overview
![app logo](images/ui/logo_size.jpg) <br>
Academy Directory (AD) is a **desktop application for CS1101S tutors to manage their students.** Its main features are as follows: 
- [Manage students’ personal details](#managing-students-personal-details)
- [Track students' grades, Studio attendance, and participation](#tracking-students-grades-studio-attendance-and-participation)
- [Visualize data in Academy Directory](#visualization-tools)

Academy Directory is written in _Java_ and thus can be run on all major operating systems!
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Academy Directory is developed as an evolution of the Address Book 3 application, primarily for usage in teaching CS1101S - Programming Methodology I - at the National University of Singapore.

***

## Information about this User Guide
### Purpose
This user guide aims to: 
- Provide first-time users with information on how to use Academy Directory
- Show [details of all commands](#features) should users face any issues using any
of the command in Academy Directory
- Answer some of the [frequently asked questions](#faq)
- Provide a [summary of all commands](#command-summary) supported by Academy Directory

### Target User
The current version of Academy Directory is specifically designed for 
**CS1101S Avengers**. Therefore, the main Target Audience of this user guide are CS1101S Avengers.
As such, the following assumptions are made regarding the Target Audience:
- Can type fast and are comfortable using a CLI.
- Is comfortable downloading and installing software such as Java 11 onto their system.
- Is familiar with the common terms relating to Computer Science.
- Is familiar with CS1101S module structure and teaching pedagogy.

While some technical background is assumed, we also provide the definitions for
certain technical terms commonly used in this user guide [here](#glossary).
***
## Quick Start
This section provides instructions to begin using Academy Directory.

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. Academy Directory has been tested on Java `11` and running on other versions might result in **bugs**.

2. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/releases) to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Academy Directory.

3. From the CLI, navigate to the folder used as *home folder* for Academy Directory and run `java -jar academydirectory.jar`. Ensure that the `.jar` file is named `academydirectory.jar`, otherwise the command will not work. 
A GUI similar to the below image should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app already contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

4. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all contacts. For new users, the list will contain some sample data which users can delete.

   * **`visualize`** : Visualize grades of students. For new users, the sample grades for the assessments will be displayed in a box plot diagram.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

5. You may refer to the [Features](#features) below for the set of features supported by Academy Directory and the details for each command. Alternatively, use `help` to get start and learn how to use our various commands.
Notes:
- While it is possible to open `academydirectory.jar` by double-clicking it, this may cause Academy Directory
related files to be saved to an indeterminate location on the computer. As such, this method is _not recommended_, especially
for beginners. 
- The `clear` command can be used to remove the sample data in Academy Directory.
- Changes to Academy Directory are automatically saved into the database.


## Preview

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features
This section shows all the commands supported by Academy Directory.

The commands are categorized based on the main features of Academy Directory: 
- Manage students’ personal details
- Track students' grades, Studio attendance, and participation
- Visualize data in Academy Directory
- Others

For better reading experience, please be familiar with the command format (shown below) as well as [some terms used](#glossary).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/streams` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/streams`, `t/envmodel t/recursion` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

***

### Managing students' personal details
#### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to Academy Directory

Format: `add n/NAME e/EMAIL te/TELE_HANDLE [p/PHONE_NUMBER]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A student can be added without phone number.
</div>

* `PHONE_NUMBER` is an optional field. The default value is `NA` which stands for "Not Applicable".
* If Avengers do not wish to enter a student's phone number, 
  * `p/` prefix can be omitted from the command.
  * Otherwise, Avengers can supply the value `NA` to `p/` prefix. Note that it must be `NA` not `N.A` or `na`
* If newly inputted students have `NAME` matching exactly (case-sensitive) with an already existing entry, the program will output a warning message and show the existing entry.\
`This student already exists in the Academy Directory.`

Examples:
* `add n/Aaron Tan te/@sausage e/e0123456@u.nus.edu p/90312311`
* `add n/Charles Ng te/@charles e/e0123434@u.nus.edu p/NA`
* `add n/Betsy Lim te/@unislave e/e0123456@u.nus.edu`

#### Deleting a student: `delete`

Deletes a student from Academy Directory by their index.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
* `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Deletes the student at the specified `INDEX`

Examples:
* `delete 2` deletes the 2nd student in the currently displayed list.

#### Tagging a student : `tag`

Tags a student.

Format: `tag INDEX t/TAG [t/TAG]...`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
* `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Assigns a `Tag` to the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* Entering the tag command with a single empty tag `t/` will remove all tags assigned to the student.
* Tags names should be alphanumeric and consist of only one word.
* For multiple tag entries, none of the tags should be empty.
* All existing tags will be replaced by the new tags.

Examples:
* `tag 1 t/` removes all tags from the student specified at index 1.
* `tag 1 t/mission` sets `mission` tag to the student specified at index 1.
* `tag 2 t/streams t/envmodel` sets `streams` and `envmodel` tags to the student specified at index 2.

#### Getting students' personal details: `get`

Gets personal details of student(s). Personal detail refers to:
- Telegram Handle
- Email address
- Telephone number, if any

Format: `get [p/] [e/] [te/] [n/NAME]`

* At least one of the supported prefix i.e. `p/`, `e/` or `te/` must be passed in.
* If `NAME` is provided, only personal detail of the student/s whose name contain the given `NAME` will be shown.
The behavior here is similar to the [filter command](#filtering-academy-directory-by-name-or-tag-filter)
* If `NAME` is not provided, the personal detail of all students in Academy Directory will be shown
* Multiple prefixes can be supplied at the same time, and personal detail corresponding to all the given prefixes will be shown
* The order in which personal details will be shown is as follows, regardless of the order of the
prefixes passed to `get` command:
  * Phone Number (p/)
  * Email (e/)
  * Telegram Handle (te/)

Examples:
* `get p/` shows the phone number of all students in Academy Directory
* `get p/ e/ te/` shows the phone number, email, and telegram handle of all students in Academy Directory
* `get p/ n/alex` shows the phone number of all students in Academy Directory whose name has `alex`
* `get p/ e/ te/ n/alex` show the phone number, email, and telegram handle of all students in Academy Directory
whose name contains `alex`

#### Editing a student's detail : `edit`

Edits a student's personal details such as their `NAME`, `PHONE`, `TELEGRAM` and `EMAIL`.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [e/EMAIL] [te/TELE_HANDLE] [p/PHONE_NUMBER]`

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* If edited `NAME` exactly matches (case-sensitive) with an already existing entry that is not the entry being edited, the program will output a warning message and show the existing entry.\
`This student already exists in the Academy Directory.`

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/e0425205@u.nus.edu`  Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student to be `91234567` and `e0425205@u.nus.edu` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Aaron Tan`  Edits the name of the 2nd student to be `Aaron Tan`.

#### Adding grades for an assessment:  `grade`
Adds a student’s grade for a particular assessment.

Format: `grade INDEX as/ASSESSMENT g/GRADE`

* Record the student’s `GRADE` for the `ASSESSMENT` based on `INDEX`
* Modifies the student(s) at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* The input `ASSESSMENT` must be one of the following: RA1, MIDTERM, RA2, PE, FINAL.
* The input `GRADE` must be a non-negative integer from 0 to 100 inclusive.

Example:
* `grade 1 as/RA1 g/15`

#### Editing a student's Studio attendance: `attendance`
Edits the attendance status of their students.

Format: `attendance INDEX ses/STUDIO_SESSION att/ATTENDANCE_STATUS`

* Edits the attendance of a student or multiple students based on their `INDEX`.
* Modifies the student(s) at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Multiple `INDEX` can be parsed in at once as long as they are all valid.
* The `STUDIO_SESSION` field is a positive integer from 1 to 12 inclusive which refers to the Studio Session to be modified.
* The `ATTENDANCE_STATUS` field can only be a 1 or 0 to indicate whether the student attended the session or not where 1 marks a student as having attended while 0 marks a student as unattended.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

Examples:

* `attendance 1 ses/1 att/1` Marks the student with index number `1` as present for studio session 1
* `attendance 1, 2, 3 ses/12 att/0` Marks students with index numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` as absent for studio session 12
* `attendance 1, 2, 3 ses/7 att/1` Marks students with index numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` as present for studio session 7

#### Editing a student’s Studio participation: `participation`

Tracks the participation of their students during the relevant studios. We will be keeping track of Studio participation with a counter system which starts at 0 by default.

Format: `participation INDEX ses/STUDIO_SESSION add/PARTICIPATION_TO_ADD`

* Edits the Studio participation of a student or multiple students based on their `INDEX`.
* Modifies the student(s) at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* The `STUDIO_SESSION` field is a positive integer from 1 to 12 inclusive which refers to the Studio Session to be modified.
* The `PARTICIPATION_TO_ADD` field is an integer from -500 to 500 inclusive which indicates the Participation score of the student.
* `PARTICIPATION_TO_ADD` will be added to the student's current Participation score
* A student’s Studio Participation score cannot be reduced below 0.
* If a student's `Attendance` is `false` and the Participation score to be added is greater than 0, the student will also be marked as having attended the Studio.

Examples:
* `participation 4 ses/9 add/1` Adds `1` to the Participation score of student with index number `4` for Studio session `9`
* `participation 1, 2, 3 ses/12 add/500`
* `participation 4, 6 ses/2 add/-300`

* `ATTRIBUTE` is case-insensitive. e.g. `name` and `NAME` will both sort the list by `Name`.
* `Average` here refers to the average score of all `Assessments`.
* `Participation` is sorted based on the average `Participation` of a `Student` across all Studio sessions.
* `Name` is sorted _lexicographically_. 
* `ORDER` can only be `asc` and `desc` which indicate either ascending or descending sort.
* `ORDER` is case-insensitive. e.g. `ASC` and `Asc` will both sort the list in ascending order
* Both `ATTRIBUTE` and `ORDER` are required for the sorting to work.

Examples:
* `sort attr/RA1 ord/desc` sorts the list in descending order based on their `RA1` grades.
* `sort attr/participation ord/asc` sorts the list in ascending order based on their participation score.

  to navigate each command, alongside the syntax for each command.

##### Viewing specific help

Format: `help COMMAND_NAME`

* Displays all information related to the command, which includes
    * What the command is about.
    * Why the command is needed.
    * What the syntax for the command is.
    * Example of usage and expected results.

Note that `help help` will result in a general help window. We do not provide instruction for the command `help` itself.

Examples:
* `help`
* `help add`: Displays the exact same content as what is shown on this User Guide for the `add` command

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**

***

#### [For Advanced Users] Viewing Commit History: `history`
Shows local commit history.

Format: `history`

- Only commands that result in a state change in Academy Directory will be committed. Such commands include
  `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear`, and more. For a full list, refer to the [appendix](#appendix-a-version-controlled-commands).
- Commits are sorted based on time, with the most recent commit shown at the top and the initial commit shown
  at the bottom
- The commit corresponding to current Academy Directory state is labelled with "(HEAD)"
- The commit corresponding to current branch is labelled with "(MAIN)"
- The commit corresponding to old branch is labelled with "(OLD)"
- Old branch is shown at the left, current branch at the right
- The corresponding commit hash is the five character string displayed
- Note that current implementation of `history` command can only show 2 branches: "OLD" and 
"MAIN". If there are already two branches and a third branch is going to be made, then the 
oldest branch will not be visible.

The following image shows the output of `history`. Note that some commits are labelled. The label "(HEAD)" is used
to indicate current state.
![historyCommand1](images/ug/historyCommand1.PNG)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**
Avengers can also browse the third menu on the top left (with the clock symbol) to execute `history` command instead
</div>

#### [For Advanced Users] Reverting Commit: `revert`
Reverts state of Academy Directory to a previous commit.

Format: `revert HASH`

- `HASH` refers to the commit hash of the commit to be reverted to
- `HASH` can be obtained using the `history` command
- Error message will be shown if attempting to revert to the current commit. This is because reverting to current
commit is unlikely to be intentional. 

The following image shows the output of `history`. The commit hashes are labelled. We can pick which commit
to revert to, and then type `revert <CORRESPONDING_HASH>` to revert to that commit. 
![historyCommand](images/ug/historyCommand.PNG)

Example:
* `revert ee5e5` reverts state of Academy Directory to the commit with hash starting with `ee5e5`

## FAQ


**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous Academy Directory home folder. Overwrite the version control folder it creates with the version
control folder of your previous Academy Directory to retain commit history.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Invalid changes to any of the version control files may result in undefined behavior as this is not an intended use case. Proceed at your own risk.
</div>

**Q**: How do I save my data?<br>
**A**: Academy Directory data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

**Q**: Can I edit the data file?<br>
**A**: Academy Directory data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/academydirectory.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Academy Directory will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

**Q**: How do I commit changes made to Academy Directory?<br>
**A**: Academy Directory implements an internal version control system (VCS) to keep track of state changes. Unlike some VCS, however, the internal VCS in Academy Directory will automatically stage and commit changes made
to Academy Directory, including commit message. Only commands that change the Academy Directory data will be staged and committed.

**Q**: Can I edit the version control files?<br>
**A**: Version control related files are saved as text files at `[JAR file location]/data/vc/`. Advanced users are welcome to
look at the files in this folder.

**Q**: When I run Academy Directory via Command Prompt, a warning message appears that there are unsupported JavaFX configurations. Do I need to be concerned about this?<br>
**A**: **No, both usability and functionality wise.** Academy Directory was not developed as a modular-based application, however, some features of our app do implement external modules not declared, and thus is the warning message. The problem has been addressed while our application was developed, but we have decided to left the warning as it is as addressing the warning is outside the scope of CS2103T and our project requirement itself.

**Q**: Why is Telegram a compulsory field and not shown on the student card, yet phone number is optional and is shown on the student card?<br>
**A**: There are many internal considerations when we design this. Initially, we have planned to put all 3 fields into the student card. However, due to some privacy concerns regarding the Telegram handles, as well as the fact that it does not look nice on the card, we decided to remove Telegram out of the card and leave it only for `view`. We may add Telegram again in the future iterations depending on the future.
