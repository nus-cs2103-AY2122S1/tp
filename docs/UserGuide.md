## Overview
Restaurant HR Helper (RHRH) is a **desktop app for managing restaurant contacts including employees, suppliers and customers, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, RHRH can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Information about this user guide

### Purpose
This user guide aims to:
* Show first time users how to use RHRH
* Provide a [summary of all commands](#command-summary) supported by RHRH
* Show [details of all commands](#features) if users face any issues while using RHRH or require a more in depth 
  explanation of the  commands
* Answer some [frequently asked questions](#faq)

### Target Audience
As RHRH is optimised for CLI users, it is targeted towards restaurant managers who can type fast and wish to 
streamline their restaurant operations by having an easy and efficient way to manage their customers, employees, 
suppliers and reservations.

</div>

### Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `rhrh.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for RHRH.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. If double-clicking the file does not work for you, from the command line, 
   navigate to the folder used as the _home folder_ for RHRH and run `java -jar rhrh.jar`. The GUI similar to the 
   below should 
   appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>  
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>  
   Some example commands you can try:
    - `addC`: Add a customer
    - Format: `addC n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS lp/LOYALTYPOINTS [alg/ALLERGIES] [sr/SPECIAL_REQUESTS] [t/TAG]...`
    - Example: `addC n/John Doe p/87654321 e/e12345@u.nus.edu a/Clementi lp/1000`

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command. If you want to have an overview of all the commands, you can refer to [Command Summary](#command-summary) section.

### Command syntax

Commands in RHRH has the syntax: `COMMAND_WORD + [PREAMBLE] + [PREFIX + PARAMETER]...`, where:

- `COMMAND_WORD` is a word that specifies an action of the command, e.g. `addC` for adding a customer, `deleteR` for deleting a reservation.
- `PREAMBLE` is the text before the first valid prefix, usually a positive number (for delete, edit or add reservation commands), or a phrase (for find commands).
- `PREFIX` is a keyword to recognize the beginning of a `PARAMETER`, usually ends with a `'/'` by convention.
- `PARAMETER` is an argument input by user. `PREAMBLE` is also a kind of `PARAMETER`. A command can have 0 or more `PARAMETER`s, which can be compulsory or optional.

Example: `addR 2 p/98765432 at/2021-12-24 2000`

- `addR` is a `COMMAND_WORD` that specifies the action of adding a new reservation.
- `2` is an `PREAMBLE` that specifies number of people.
- `p/`, `at/` are prefixes for phone and date-time, respectively.
- `2`, `98765432` and `2021-12-24 2000` are `PARAMETER`s

This is the list of all prefixes used in RHRH, as well as their corresponding parameter constraints:

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Command words are case-insensitive. <br>
  e.g. `editE 1` is the same as `edite 1`

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addC n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend` `t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `resetC`, `resetE`, `resetS`, `listC`, `listE`, `listS`, `listR`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
 e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
* Users can use all customer/employee/supplier/reservation commands including from  `listC`, `listE`, `listS`, and `listR` to switch to the customer/employee/supplier list respectively
 <br> e.g. If a user is currently viewing the customer list, using `addE`, `editE`, `sortE` etc. while the customer list is active will execute the respective employee command and switch to the employee list automatically
