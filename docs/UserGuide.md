## **Introduction**

Welcome to the User Guide of **TuitiONE**!

**TuitiONE** is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based application that aims to **simplify the work of Customer Service Officers (CSO) in a tuition centre**.
The application also incorporates the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
**TuitiONE** allows CSOs to input the details of students and parents through simple and intuitive commands. With our application, a CSO's work would be reduced and efficient.

If you can type fast, **TuitiONE** can get your contact management tasks done faster than most other GUI apps. The GUI application would allow you to interact with the application
through graphical icons (such as buttons).

However you do not have to worry even if you are new to CLI / GUI applications. **TuitiONE** uses easy to learn and simple CLI commands that usually fall under one sentence.
Moreover, this User Guide will take you through every feature of **TuitiONE**, providing you with the easiest and best user experience possible.

If you are interested, jump to [Quick start](#quick-start) to learn how to start up **TuitiONE** in a simple and quick manner.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Features**

This section outlines all the features that **TuitiONE** has. You will be able to see the purpose of each feature, the format of each command and possible examples and images of what you should expect to see.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used as many times as the user would like.<br>
  e.g. `[r/REMARK]…` can be used multiple times like `r/sick` or `r/absent r/graduated`, or can be omitted altogether.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PARENT_CONTACT`, `p/PARENT_CONTACT n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will ignore follow-up inputs.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Caution on use of the symbol `/` in commands:**<br>

* For all commands, the symbol `/` should only be used in the **representation of prefixes**, such as `n/`, `p/` and `r/`, etc.

* You **should not** use the symbol `/` when filling up any of the parameters.

* For example,  in `add` command,

  * **Acceptable** command: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/jd@gmail.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 g/P2`.

  * **Invalid** command: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/jd@gmail.com a/John stre/et, block 123, #01-01 g/P2`.<br>_*notice the additional `/` used in the parameter of `a/ADDRESS`._

<br>

Upon entering the `list` command, both student and lesson panels will be updated to show all the students and lessons present.

#### Filtering of list: `filter`

Filter the respective list(s) to display entries that correspond to the conditions as specified.

Command Format: `filter [g/GRADE] [s/SUBJECT]`

:information_source: **Details:**

* You can filter by `GRADE`, `SUBJECT`, or both.

    * If you are only filtering by `GRADE`, both of the student list and lesson list will be filtered to display the respective entries that correspond to the `GRADE` as specified.

    * If you are only filtering by `SUBJECT`, only the lesson list will be filtered to display the respective lessons that correspond to the `SUBJECT` as specified.

    * If you are filtering by both `GRADE` and `SUBJECT`, both of the student list and lesson list will be filtered to display the respective entries that correspond to the `GRADE` and `SUBJECT` as specified.

* `GRADE` refers to the educational level of the student. It can be specified in lower- or upper- case (i.e. `P5` and `p5` represents the same grade).

* `SUBJECT` can be specified in lower- or upper- cases (i.e. `MATH` and `math` represents the same subject which is `Math`). See the [`add-l`](#adding-a-lesson-add-l) command for more information.

Example(s):

* `ADDRESS` can only have a maximum of **150** characters.

* `GRADE` refers to the educational level of the student. It can only be in a range of `P1`-`P6` (primary school levels) or `S1`-`S5` (secondary school levels). Here specifying lower case will also be a valid grade input (e.g. `p3` is allowed and will be read in the application as `P3`).

* `REMARK` can have a maximum of **25** characters, single worded without spacings in between them (e.g `smart` is valid, while `needs help` is invalid). A student can have any number of remarks, capped at **5** including 0.

* Each student must have a unique name.

* Phone numbers are not unique as multiple students may share the same parent.

Example(s):

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/jd@gmail.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 g/P2`

* `add n/Betsy Crowe p/91234567 e/bc@gmail.com a/Bleecker street, block 123, #01-01 g/S5 r/foreign student`

* Only keywords based on name will be searched.

* Prefixed matching words will be supported e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`.

* Students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.

Example(s):

* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`

## **FAQ**

1. Where can I view the list of commands?

    > You can type `help` or you can click on the 'Help' tab on the top left of the app window (see [`help`](#viewing-help-help) for more).

1. Why are some unusual email address inputs valid, such as 'jd@gmail.com.this.that.this'?

    > There are many possible email addresses and domains such as school email address and personal domains, hence **TuitiONE** will not provide a thorough checking in this current version. If there is any scenario where you have inputted the wrong email address and would like to change it, refer to the the [`edit`](#editing-a-student--edit) command.

1. Why am I unable to add a student with the same name as another student?

    > Currently our system identifies uniqueness of students by their name, hence you are unable to add students with the same name. We are working on an update to identify uniqueness through the combination of the name and phone number, allowing for multiple students of the same name to be in our **TuitiONE**.

1. How do I edit a lesson?

    > In the current version of **TuitiONE**, you will need to use [`delete-l`](#deleting-a-lesson-delete-l) and [`add-l`](#adding-a-lesson-add-l) to make your edits, then re-enroll the students. In the upcoming updates, there will be an `edit-l` command that will allow for the editing of lessons.

1. How do I edit a remark of a Student?

    > To edit a student's remark, you will need to use the `dr/` and `r/` prefixes in the [`edit`](#editing-a-student--edit) command to make any changes.

1. Am I able to add or edit remarks to have spacings within them?

    > No. The number of characters each remark can have is capped at **25**, and must be single words (see [`add`](#adding-a-student-add) for more).

1. Am I able to use "4PM" instead of "1600" for my timings when creating a new lesson?

    > No. **TuitiONE** only accepts timings that follow the **24** hours format. Additionally, timings must also be in intervals of 30 minutes For instance, `1400` and `1430` are valid inputs, while `1415` is an invalid input (see [`add-l`](#adding-a-lesson-add-l) for more).

1. How long can a name be when I add/edit a student?

    > We have imposed a **150** character limit for the respective names of students. Students with names longer than **150** characters should be represented with their initials instead (see [`add`](#adding-a-student-add) for more).

1. Can lessons of the same subject and grade start at the same time?

    > No. **TuitiONE** would consider a lesson of the same `SUBJECT` and `GRADE` that start at the same time on the same day as a conflict (see [`add-l`](#adding-a-lesson-add-l) for more).

1. How many lessons can a student be enrolled in?

    > A student can be enrolled in a maximum of **10** lessons at any time. **TuitiONE** will not allow a student to be enrolled in more than **10** lessons (see [`enroll`](#enrolling-a-student-from-lesson-enroll) for more).

1. How many students can a lesson contain?

    > A lesson can have up to **15** students enrolled in at any time. **TuitiONE** will not allow a lesson to have more than **15** students enrolled at any time (see [`enroll`](#enrolling-a-student-from-lesson-enroll) for more).

1. Why are there some unusual files present in my folder after I run **TuitiONE**?

    > **TuitiONE** currently is a local desktop application, and hence the application would need to store the data you have inputted into these files. These files contain your personal preferences as well as the student and lesson data your tuition center holds. As such do not delete these files as you may potentially lose all your data.
