### 2.3 Creating your first order

This is a step-by-step guide to help you get started in creating your first order.
If you have not installed BobTheBistroBoss, you may do so by following the instructions [here](#21-installation).

For this guide, we will simulate the following scenario:

Your regular customer John Doe wishes to place two orders, one on 10 December 2021 and the other on 11 December 2021.
Both of these orders are to be delivered at 12pm. For both of these orders, he will require 3 tuna sandwiches. Each
tuna sandwich will be priced at $2.

Here are the details of John Doe:
* Name: John Doe
* Phone Number: 92345678
* Email: johndoe@gmail.com
* Address: Blk 422, Bedok North Road, #15-25

Here are the ingredients that will be used for the tuna sandwich:

* 2 slices of bread
* 1 slice of cheese
* 1 can of tuna

Suppose you currently have these ingredients with you:

* 100 slices of bread
* 100 slices of cheese
* 100 cans of tuna

#### 2.3.1 Approach 1

We can proceed to add the first order on 10 December 2021 by entering the following
command in the command box at the bottom of the app:

`add-o cn/John Doe cp/92345678 ca/Blk 422, Bedok North Road, #15-25 rn/Tuna Sandwich ri/Bread-2-slices, Cheese-1-slices, Tuna-1-cans op/6 oq/3 od/10-12-2021 1200`

You will notice that the order has been added to the Orders list (orders are sorted by deadline and are grouped by their completion status).
However, this is not the recommended approach, especially for repeated orders, as it can be very inefficient. Furthermore, this approach does
not allow you to track ingredients in your inventory. We will now add the second order using our recommended approach.

#### 2.3.2 Approach 2 (Recommended)

Firstly, switch over to the Inventory & Statistics tab by entering the following command:

`tab 2`

Remember the ingredients you had? After your first order, you will be left with 94 slices of bread, 97 slices of
cheese and 97 cans of tuna. We will proceed to add them to the inventory by entering the following commands:

`add-i in/Bread iq/94 iu/slices`

`add-i in/Cheese iq/97 iu/slices`

`add-i in/Tuna iq/97 iu/cans`

You will notice that the ingredients, bread, cheese and tuna have been added to the Inventory list
(ingredients are sorted alphabetically).

Next, we will switch back to the Home tab by entering the following command:

`tab 1`

Let's start by adding our recipe to the Recipe Bookmarks list by entering the following command:

`add-r rn/Tuna Sandwich ri/Bread-2-slices, Cheese-1-slices, Tuna-1-cans rp/2`

You will notice that the recipe has been added to the Recipe Bookmarks list (recipes are sorted alphabetically). Take
note of the index of the recipe bookmark. We will refer to this index as `RECIPE_INDEX`.

Now, we will also add our client to the Client Bookmarks list by entering the following command:

`add-c cn/John Doe cp/92345678 ce/johndoe@gmail.com ca/Blk 422, Bedok North Road, #15-25`

You will notice that the client has been to the Client Bookmarks list (clients are sorted alphabetically). Take
note of the index of the client bookmark. We will refer to this index as `CLIENT_INDEX`.

Finally, we will add our order by entering the following command:

`add-o c/CLIENT_INDEX r/RECIPE_INDEX oq/3 od/11-12-2021 1200`

Replace `CLIENT_INDEX` and `RECIPE_INDEX` with the respective indexes you took note of in the
previous steps. You will notice that the order has been added to the Orders list. This approach is more efficient as
the client and recipe details are copied from their respective bookmarks into the order. If you switch
to the Inventory & Statistics tab, you will also notice how the quantities for the ingredients, tuna, bread and
cheese have been deducted allowing you to track your inventory. To learn more about the available commands, you may
head onto our [Features](#4-features) section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Overview of Features

### 3.1 Client (Bookmarks)
If you often sell meals to repeat clients, the client bookmarks feature will be useful.
Client bookmarks contain information like name, phone, email and address.
Some of these details can be copied to an order so that you do not have to type their information over and over again.

Do note that the **details are copied to the order, this means that editing a client bookmark will not edit
an order** that previously copied client details from it. This gives you flexibility to change details within an order
and client bookmark without affecting other orders and client bookmarks.
For example, if your usual client happens to have a different delivery address just for one order,
or if your client changes his phone number in the future, it will not affect records of past orders.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bookmark: Note:**<br>

* Client bookmarks are considered duplicates when they have the same phone number.

* You cannot have duplicate client bookmarks in the application.

* Client bookmarks may also be referred to as Clients for simplicity.

* Client bookmarks are sorted in ascending alphabetical order of client name.
  Uppercase letters appear before lowercase letters.

* You can use all client commands from any tab.

</div>

### 3.2 Inventory
As you probably need to handle many ingredients, the inventory helps you keep track of your stock.
It displays a list of ingredients whose quantities can be tracked.
When you create, edit or delete an order with ingredients,
the quantities of matching ingredients in your inventory will be adjusted accordingly.

Do note that the application currently allows you to track quantities from 0 to 40000
as stated in our [disclaimers](#65-quantities).
We believe that the range provided is sufficient for you to track your ingredients.
For example, once the quantity reaches 0, additional tracking may not be helpful
as you have to restock and will probably buy ingredients in bulk.
However, feel free to give us feedback for future iterations.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bookmark: Note:**<br>

* Ingredients are considered duplicates or matches when they have the same name and unit.
  The matching of name and unit are case-insensitive.

* You cannot have duplicate ingredients in the inventory.

* Ingredients in the inventory are sorted by ascending alphabetical order of ingredient name.
  Uppercase letters appear before lowercase letters.

* You can use all ingredient commands from any tab.

</div>

### 3.3 Orders
The orders feature helps you manage your orders.
You can track client details, recipe details, order price, quantity, deadline and status with this feature.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bookmark: Note:**<br>

* Orders are considered duplicates when they have the same client details, recipe details, deadline and price.
  The matching of details are case-insensitive where applicable.

* You cannot have duplicate orders in the application.

* Orders are sorted by completion status, then deadline. Uncompleted orders appear before completed orders.
  Within each group of uncompleted and completed orders, orders with earlier deadlines are higher in the list.

* You can use all order commands from any tab.

</div>

### 3.4 Recipe (Bookmarks)
If you frequently receive orders for your signature dishes, the recipe bookmarks feature will be useful.
Recipe bookmarks contain information like name, ingredients and price.
These details can be copied over to an order so that you do not have to type these details over and over again.

Do note that the details are copied to the order,
this means that **editing a recipe bookmark will not edit an order** that previously copied recipe details from it.
This gives you flexibility to change details within an order without affecting other orders and recipe bookmarks.
For example if your client for an order has an allergy to peanuts, you can copy your usual recipe to the order and remove peanuts,
without affecting other orders that copied from the recipe before.
You can also change your recipe bookmarks, for example to increase its price, without affecting the integrity of past order records.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bookmark: Note:**<br>

* Recipe bookmarks are considered duplicates when they have the same name, ingredients and price.
  The matching of details are case-insensitive where applicable.

* You cannot have duplicate recipe bookmarks in the application.

* Recipe bookmarks may also be referred to as Recipes for simplicity.

* Recipe bookmarks are sorted by ascending alphabetical order of recipe name.
  Uppercase letters appear before lowercase letters.

* You can use all recipe commands from any tab.

</div>

### 3.5 Statistics
You may find it handy to track your business performance.
BTBB offers 3 types of statistics to help you with that!

They are:
* Revenue per month for the past 12 months.
* Top 10 most frequent clients, who made the highest number of orders.
* Top 10 most popular recipes, that appear most frequently in all orders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that are to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add-o cn/CLIENT_NAME`, `CLIENT_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-o cn/John Doe`.

* You may omit items in square brackets as they are optional. However, there may be exceptions to this rule
  please refer to the **Note** section under each command for more details.<br>
  e.g. `cn/CLIENT_NAME [ri/INGREDIENT_NAME-QUANTITY-UNIT, ...]` can be used as `cn/John Doe ri/Garlic-1-whole` or as
  `cn/John Doe`.

* You can provide the parameters in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `cn/CLIENT_NAME cp/CLIENT_PHONE`, `cp/CLIENT_PHONE cn/CLIENT_NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence
  of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `cp/12341234 cp/56785678`, only `cp/56785678` will be taken.

* Any extraneous parameters supplied by you for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, and `list-c`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Only prefixes stated in the command are recognised as prefixes for the command.<br>
  e.g. if a command does not recognise `rp/` as a prefix, it will be considered as part of your user input.

* You should note that the format of all date fields is `dd-MM-yyyy`.<br>
  e.g. 21-10-1998 is 21 October 1998.

* You should note that the format of all deadline fields is `dd-MM-yyyy HHmm`.<br>
  e.g. 21-10-1998 1830 is 21 October 1998 6.30pm.

* You should note that the format of all phone parameters is a series of up to 20 digits with no spacing between digits.

* You should note that address parameters have no restrictions on their format. But they should contain at least one non-space character.

* You should note that the following parameters allow up to 50 characters (including spaces):

  rn/RECIPE_NAME [ri/INGREDIENT_NAME-QUANTITY-UNIT, ...] op/ORDER_PRICE od/ORDER_DEADLINE [oq/ORDER_QUANTITY]`

1. Only recipe index used (must provide client details): <br>
  `add-o cn/CLIENT_NAME cp/CLIENT_PHONE ca/CLIENT_ADDRESS r/RECIPE_INDEX [rn/RECIPE_NAME]
  [ri/INGREDIENT_NAME-QUANTITY-UNIT, ...] [op/ORDER_PRICE] od/ORDER_DEADLINE [oq/ORDER_QUANTITY]`

1. Both client and recipe indexes used: <br>
  `add-o c/CLIENT_INDEX [cn/CLIENT_NAME] [cp/CLIENT_PHONE] [ca/CLIENT_ADDRESS] r/RECIPE_INDEX
  [rn/RECIPE_NAME] [ri/INGREDIENT_NAME-QUANTITY-UNIT, ...] [op/ORDER_PRICE] od/ORDER_DEADLINE [oq/ORDER_QUANTITY]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bookmark: Note:**<br>

* `od/ORDER_DEADLINE` includes date and time, it must follow the format specified [above](#4-features).

**Client details** include client name, phone and address, they must be provided in one of these ways:
* If `c/CLIENT_INDEX` is provided (Format 2 and 4),
  * client details are copied from the client bookmark at the given index to the order.
  * If `cn/`, `cp/` or `ca/` are provided with `c/`, the respective client detail is taken from `cn/`, `cp/` or `ca/` instead.
* If `c/CLIENT_INDEX` is not provided (Format 1 and 3),
  * `cn/`, `cp/` and `ca/` must be provided.

**Recipe details** include recipe name, ingredients and price. Recipe name and order price must be provided in one of these ways:
* If `r/RECIPE_INDEX` is provided (Format 3 and 4),
  * recipe details are copied from the recipe bookmark at the given index to the order.
  * `ORDER_PRICE` is calculated by multiplying the copied `RECIPE_PRICE` with `QUANTITY` of the order.
  * If `rn/`, `ri/` or `op/` is provided with `r/`, the respective recipe detail is taken from `rn/`, `ri/` or `op/` instead.
* If `r/` is not provided (Format 1 and 2),
  * `rn/` and `op/` must be provided.

These details are fully optional:
* `oq/ORDER_QUANTITY` is set to 1 by default, if not specified. If specified, it must be positive, and the largest possible input is 40000.
* `ri/INGREDIENT_NAME-QUANTITY-UNIT, ...` does not need to be specified. If specified, all `QUANTITY` supplied must be positive, and the largest possible input is 40000.


Secondary processes that happen when you add an order:
* For each ingredient in the order, the inventory will find [matching ingredients](#32-inventory) and decrease their quantity.
  The inventory quantity is decreased by the ingredient quantity in the order, multiplied by the order quantity.
  If the ingredient in the order does not exist in the inventory, there is no effect.
* All orders have an uncompleted status upon addition.

**When an order is added with one or more ingredients that are tracked in the inventory,
the application will still allow the addition of an order even if the ingredient quantities are not enough to fulfil the order.
It is your responsibility to keep the inventory restocked so that our ingredient tracking works as intended.
Please read our [disclaimers about ingredient quantities](#65-quantities) to learn more.**

#### 4.5.2 Adding an order ingredient: `add-oi`

You can add an ingredient to an order in the application using this command.

Format: `add-oi INDEX in/INGREDIENT_NAME iq/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY iu/INGREDIENT_UNIT`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bookmark: Note:**<br>

* `INDEX` allows you to choose which order to add ingredients to by specifying its position in the currently displayed
  order list.

* `INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` supplied by you must be positive, and the largest possible input is 40000.

* An ingredient already exists in an order if it has the same `INGREDIENT_NAME` and `INGREDIENT_UNIT` as an existing ingredient in the order's ingredient sub-list.

* Ingredients that already exist in the order cannot be added again. Instead, you should perform delete order ingredient command
  before performing this command again.

* If the added ingredient [exists in the inventory](#32-inventory), the quantity deducted from
  the inventory will be equivalent to the ingredient quantity in the order multiplied by the order quantity.

**When an order ingredient is added to the order with an ingredient that is tracked in the inventory,
the application will still allow the addition of the order ingredient even if the ingredient quantity is not enough to fulfil the order.
It is your responsibility to keep the inventory restocked so that our tracking works as intended.
Please read our [disclaimers about ingredient quantities](#65-quantities) to learn more.**

</div>

**Examples:**
* `add-oi 1 in/Rice iq/400 iu/g` Adds 400 g of Rice to the ingredients of the first order.

#### 4.5.3 Deleting an order: `delete-o`

You can delete an order from the application using this command.

Format: `delete-o INDEX`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:bookmark: Note:**<br>

* `INDEX` allows you to choose which order to delete by specifying its position in the currently displayed order list.

* When an order is deleted from the list, its ingredient quantities are added back to matching ingredients in the inventory. However, if the
  order is already marked as done, its ingredient quantities will not be added back.

**When an order with ingredients that are tracked in the inventory is deleted,
the application will still allow the deletion of the order even if any of the ingredient quantities has reached the upper limit of 40000.
We believe that the upper limit of the ingredient quantity is sufficient for normal use.
If there is a need to change the quantity above the limit, consider changing the ingredient unit instead.
Please read our [disclaimers about ingredient quantities](#65-quantities) to learn more.**

</div>

**Examples:**
* `delete-o 1` Deletes the order at index 1 in the order list currently shown.

#### 4.5.4 Deleting an order ingredient: `delete-oi`

You can delete an ingredient from an order in the application using this command.

Format: `delete-oi ORDER_INDEX i/INGREDIENT_INDEX`

  displayed order list.

* `INGREDIENT_INDEX` allows you to choose which ingredient to delete from the order by specifying its position in the
  currently displayed order ingredient sub-list.

* If the deleted ingredient [exists in the inventory](#32-inventory), the quantity added back to the inventory will
  be equivalent to the ingredient quantity in the order multiplied by the order quantity.

**When an order ingredient that is tracked in the inventory is deleted from the order,
the application will still allow the deletion of the order ingredient even if the ingredient quantity has reached the upper limit of 40000.
We believe that the upper limit of the ingredient quantity is sufficient for normal use.
If there is a need to change the quantity above the limit, consider changing the ingredient unit instead.

#### 4.7.2 Viewing top 10 most frequent clients
* Your top 10 most frequent clients, who made the highest number of orders will be shown in a pie chart.
* We rank the frequency of clients by compare the number of orders each client made. <br>
  (e.g. Compare this sequence of orders: Amy ordered 'Chicken Rice x 2', Bob ordered 'Fried Rice x 4' and then Amy ordered 'Chicken Rice x 1'. <br>
  Amy is a more frequent client as she made more orders than Bob, regardless of the `ORDER_QUANTITY` for each order.)
* Ties are broken arbitrarily i.e. If there are multiple clients with the same number of orders, 10 random clients
  will be displayed.
* Values will be displayed when you hover your cursor over each wedge.

### 4.9 Saving the data

BTBB will save to the hard disk automatically after execution of any command that changes the data. There is no need
for you to save manually.

### 4.10 Editing the data file

BTBB saves its data as a JSON file. Advanced users are welcome to update the data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file results in the format being invalid, BTBB will discard all data and start with an
empty data file at the next run.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the application in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that
contains the data of your previous BTBB home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Disclaimers

### 6.1 Data
* App starts with seed data if there is no initial data file.
* If you edit the JSON file with invalid data, the application
  will not show any data on startup.

### 6.2 Format
* For deadlines, 29-12-2021 2400 is considered valid, and it will be
  represented as 30-12-2021 0000 in the application.

### 6.3 Index
* When an `INDEX` directly after a command word has an incorrect format, the application displays the `Invalid Command Format!` error. <br>
  (e.g. edit-o -3)

* When an `INDEX` directly after a prefix is invalid, the application displays the `Invalid index. Index should be a positive whole number.` error. <br>
  (e.g. add-o c/-2 r/0 od/12-12-2022 1200)

### 6.4 Price
* Prices can be a whole number or a decimal value with **exactly** 2 decimal places.
* The largest possible recipe price is $2499.99.
* The largest possible order price is $99,999,999.99.
* Changes made to an existing order's quantity will not update the order price. <br>
  (e.g. For an existing order of 1 Apple Pie, priced at $5,
  if the order has been edited to 2 Apple Pies, the price of the order remains at $5.)

### 6.5 Quantities
* If you change any quantity field in orders in the JSON file, the
  application will not automatically reflect the corresponding changes
  in the inventory.
* Ingredient quantity cannot change beyond the lower boundary of 0
  and the upper boundary of 40000. <br>
  (e.g. If the user reaches the upper boundary and tries to increase
  the quantity further by deleting an existing order that uses the
  ingredient, the system will allow the deletion but inventory no
  longer tracks the ingredient properly.)

### 6.6 Restrictions
* A Phone number allows up to 20 digits.

* The following parameters allow up to 50 characters (including whitespace):
  * Client Name
  * Ingredient Name
  * Order Name
