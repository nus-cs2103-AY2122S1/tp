![CSBook](images/CSBook.png)

Welcome to the CSBook User Guide! **CSBook is a desktop app for Computer Science (CS) Teaching Assistants (TAs) to manage their students. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are faster at typing, CSBook can get your student management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

As a CS TA, do you find yourself using Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets to track the academic performance of your students? Do you use note-taking applications like notepad or Evernote to jot down notes of your students' strengths and weaknesses? Do you create special Telegram folders or Discord channels just to keep track of the different consultation groups that you are hosting? If you answered yes to any of the questions above, CSBook is the ideal application for you!

CSBook helps to **lessen your workload** and **saves you the trouble of having to use multiple external applications** to keep track of all the students that you teach. With CSBook, you can **maintain your students' contact details, track your students' academic progress, store notes for each student, and manage different consultations groups / modules**, all in one application! This allows you to manage your students in a **more intuitive and efficient** manner, which will free up more time for you to teach and help your students.

If you are interested by what we have said thus far, jump right to the [How to use](#how-to-use) section in the user guide to start on your CSBook journey!

## GUI

This section will provide you with a brief introduction of our GUI.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: GUI is optimised when window is maximised to full screen. Names and error messages may appear truncated for smaller screen sizes.**
</div>

### Main Screen

![Ui](images/ug1.png)

The main screen would show two panels which consist of the list of students and list of groups respectively.

The student card which represents each student will have the student’s name and the group they belong to.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: A student would be flagged red if their score on the most recent assessment falls below the passing threshold of 50%.**
</div>

The group card which represents each group will have the group’s name and description.

The command box is located at the bottom of the window in which you can enter the commands.

### Detailed Student Page

![Ui](images/ug2.png)

This is the detailed student page which consists of the student’s information -- group the student belongs to, contact details, list of assessments and notes on the student.

For assessments, the assessment name, score the student received and percentage of performance would be displayed.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: An assessment would be flagged red if the student’s score falls below the passing threshold of 50%.**
</div>
---

## Feature List

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Jun Wei`.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE`, `t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Optional parameters/fields will be indicated within square brackets.
  e.g. if the command specifies `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE] [e/EMAIL]`, `edit 1 n/Jia Xian` or `edit 1 n/Jia Xian t/@albino_monkey e/e0540014X@u.nus.edu` are both acceptable commands.

- For parameters that expect a number value, such as `INDEX` of a student or `SCORE` for assessments, if you try to enter an extremely large value, CSBook will not behave as expected. This is because for assessments to have total scores above a few hundreds or for a TA to have more than a few thousand students is considered unrealistic.

- For parameters that expect a string value i.e. non-numeric value, such as `NAME` of a student or `GROUPNAME` of a group, if you try to enter extremely long values, the name may be truncated. This is because for students or groups to have extremely long names is considered unrealistic.

- If you specify a parameter multiple times when it is expected only once in the command, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `t/@albino_monkii t/@albino_api`, only `t/@albino_api` will be taken.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
</div>

   <br><br>
   ![result after 'clear'](images/clear0.png)

#### Encrypting the data file: `encrypt`

Encrypts the CSBook data file by converting data into a non-human-readable format to protect the data from access by undesirable parties.

**Format:** `encrypt`

**Steps:**

1. Type `encrypt` into the command box.

#### Decrypting the data file: `decrypt`

Decrypts the CSBook data file by converting data back into a human-readable format from its previously encrypted state.

**Format:** `decrypt`

**Steps:**

1. Type `decrypt` into the command box.

#### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

**Format:** `exit`

**Steps:**

1. Type `exit` into the command box.
2. CSBook has been closed successfully.

#### Saving the data

CSBook data is saved in the hard disk automatically after you have used any command that changes the data. There is no need for you to save manually. The data is decrypted by default, but you may encrypt them using the `encrypt` command listed above.

#### Editing the data file

CSBook data is saved as an JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/csbook`. If you are a more advanced user, you are welcome to update data by editing the data file directly .

Note that if you have enabled the encrypt function, the data will be saved in an encrypted JSON format. In which case, you are highly advised to decrypt the data file with the `decrypt` command before editing the data file directly.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:** If there are changes to the data file that makes its format invalid or if the data has invalid values, CSBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file on the next run.<br/><br/>

:warning: **Warning**: Do not intentionally change the data file in order to restart CSBook afresh with an empty data file. You should use the `clear` command instead if you want to clear all currently stored data.

</div>

### Student management features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note**: Listed in this section are all the features and commands you can use to manage your students and their information in CSBook. The information you stored for each student will be collated into a single entry to help you keep track of them.
</div>

#### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to the CSBook.

**Format:** `add n/NAME t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE e/EMAIL g/GROUP_NAME`

**Steps:**

2. A pop-up is shown saying that the student has been successfully added, and the new student can be seen in the student list.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note on command use**:
- `NAME` is case-sensitive and must be unique. Thus, it is possible to have two students named `John Green` and `john Green`, but it is not possible to have two students named `Alfred` and `Alfred`
- The `EMAIL` used can be any email; it need not be an NUS email.
- Each student **MUST** belong to a group. The group name must correspond to that of an existing group, which means that the group should be added to CSBook before the student is created.
- Each student can only belong to one group.

:bulb: **Tip**:

- If you have two students with the exact name, you may use numbers to differentiate them. e.g. `Lim Jun Wei 1` and `Lim Jun Wei 2`
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note on groups**: Refer to the "Group management features" section for more details on how you may use groups to enhance the way you track students.
