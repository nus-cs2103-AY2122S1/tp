Managera is a **desktop app that _provides event organisers with a convenient method of keeping track of upcoming 
[events](#glossary) and the details of their [participants](#glossary)_**. It does not handle communication between the 
event organiser and the participants.

Managera is OS-independent, meaning it will work on any operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux).

   how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/UG-screenshots/Ui_labelled.png)

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g., typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will 
   open the help window. <br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all participants.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a participant

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the [parameters](#glossary) to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g., in `addEvent n/NAME d/DATE`, `n/NAME` and `d/DATE` are parameters which can be used as 
  `addEvent n/CS2103T Final d/2021-11-23`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g., `addEvent n/NAME d/DATE [t/TIME]` can be used as `addEvent n/CS2103T Final d/2021-11-23 t/1700` or as 
  `addEvent n/CS2103T Final d/2021-11-23`.

* Parameters with [prefixes](#glossary) can be in any order.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DATE`, `d/DATE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Parameters without prefixes needs to be followed strictly.<br>
  e.g., `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [d/BIRTHDATE]` INDEX must strictly be the first parameter 
  while the others with prefix can be in any order after that.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of 
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g., if you specify `t/1700 t/1800`, only `t/1800` will be taken.

* If a command does not take in any parameters, (namely `help`, `list`, `clear`, `sortEvents` and 
  `exit`) then any extra words added after the command will be ignored.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `sortEvents 123`, it will be interpreted as `sortEvents`.

</div>

* [View a participant's details](#viewing-a-participants-details-view), 
* [Add a Next-of-Kin to a participant](#adding-a-next-of-kin-to-a-participant-addnok) and 
* [Delete a Next-of-Kin of a participant](#deleting-a-next-of-kin-of-a-participant-deletenok).

  birthdate, they are treated as two different participants. (The new participant will be added.)

## Saving the data

Managera saves data in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. 
There is no need to save manually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Editing the data file

Managera's data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/managera.json`. Advanced users are welcome to 
update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Managera will discard all data and start with an empty data 
file at the next run.
</div>

## Features in the next update v1.5: 

### Undo event completion: `undone`

Marks the specified event in Managera as undone.

Format: `undone INDEX`

* Marks the completed(done) event at the specified `INDEX` as undone.
* The index refers to the index number of the event shown in the displayed event list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Example Usage:

* `undone 3` - Marks the 3rd event in the displayed event list as undone.


## Modifications in the next update v1.5:

### Event Time period

Currently, events only have a start datetime and do not have an end datetime. In v1.5, events will be revamped to
include an end datetime. This will allow events to occupy a period of time instead of only a specific date
and time. More details of the revamp will be made available in v1.5 Patch notes when it is released.

### Detect clashes in schedule

Currently, participants can be enrolled into an infinite number of events regardless of whether doing so would result in a clash in schedule.
Enrolling participants would require users to be aware of possible clashes. With the implementation of event Time period,
updates will also include a mechanism to check for schedule clashes in v1.5. This will reduce the hassle for users to
check for possible schedule clashes manually when enrolling a participant.

## Glossary

The glossary contains definitions for terms which you may not fully understand.

**Participant**: A person that is participating in or attending some given event.<br>

**Event**: An event that will be conducted in real life e.g., a competition, meeting, social activity etc.<br>

**Home Folder**: The home folder for Managera is the folder which you have placed `managera.jar` in. You are strongly 
recommended creating a new folder for Managera instead of running it on the desktop, as Managera will be 
creating new files and folders in the same directory.

**Command**: A command is a specific instruction that you give to Managera to perform a certain action, like adding a 
new participant to the list. Commands will be the primary way that you will interact with Managera.<br>

**Parameter**: Parameters are pieces of data that must be passed to certain commands to tell Managera which actions to 
perform. For example, the `done` command requires a single integer as a parameter so that it knows which event to mark 
as done.<br>

**Prefix**: Prefixes are unique identifiers in front of parameters so that Managera understands what kind of values 
they are. For example, the prefix "n/" lets Managera know that a name is expected to follow behind it, while the 
prefix "d/" lets Managera know that a date is expected.<br>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install and run Managera in the other computer. Then overwrite the empty save file it creates with the save file 
from your previous computer. The save file of Managera is found in `[JAR file location]/data/managera.json`.

**Q**: Does Managera have a mobile version?<br>
**A**: Managera currently does not operate on any other platform other than desktop.

**Q**: I accidentally exited Managera by closing the window rather than using the given `exit` command, what do I 
do?<br>
**A**: Since Managera automatically saves your data to the hard disk after each change, it should not reverse any 
changes you have made in the session. Your progress is most likely preserved after restarting Managera.
