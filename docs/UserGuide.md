ePoch is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It has been designed for the busy NUS student, allowing the user to create contacts for persons and to create CCAs, link those persons and CCAs together, and to create periodic reminders for those CCAs.

It is intended to be used by NUS students, to help keep track of the students and organizations that they encounter.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the JAR file, which can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.4).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ePoch app.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI, similar to the one shown above, should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

1. Enter commands in the command box and press Enter to execute them. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all persons, CCAs and reminders currently stored in ePoch.

   * **`addp n/Tan Wei Yang a/CAPT e/tanweiyang@u.nus.edu p/94492210`** Adds a person named `Tan Wei Yang`, with address `CAPT`, email `tanweiyang@u.nus.edu`, and phone number `94492210` to ePoch.

   * **`deletep 3`** : Deletes the person with id 3, ie. shown as third in the list of persons.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all data (persons, CCAs and reminders) from ePoch.

   * **`exit`** : Exits ePoch.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) segment below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addc n/CCA_NAME [t/TAG]`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addc n/NUSSO`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/NUSHackers t/cool` or as `n/NUSHackers`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

Note: ePoch has a capacity of 1,000,000,000 persons, CCAs and reminders each.

### Editing the data file

ePoch data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the `addressbook.json` file that contains the data from your previous ePoch home folder.

**Q**: Can I create a reminder without linking it to a CCA?<br>
**A**: No. We do not support that functionality: all reminders must be linked to a CCA in some way.
