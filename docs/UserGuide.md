### 3.2 Application Homepage Explanation

Here is how our application's homepage works

![UiExplanation](images/UiExplanation.png)

#### 3.2.1 GUI Buttons
* Buttons have been placed at the top of our application to help you to exit the application and access the help function using your mouse.

#### 3.2.2 Command Box
* Here is the location for you to key in your inputs.

#### 3.2.3 Output Display
* Here is where our application will echo out your inputs entered.
* Results will also be displayed in this section when the appropriate commands have been inputted.

#### 3.2.4 Module List
* Here are the modules stored in our [database](#database).
* Do note that we have included some modules for you to test out our [features](#4-features).

#### 3.2.5 MC Goal Progress

Tracks and displays the number of MCs completed in total, and for each course requirement. <br>

![MCs Display](images/MCsDisplay.png)

The user's progress is displayed in the form of:
* The number of MCs completed for that category, over the number of required MCs.
* A progress bar filled according to the level of completion.

**Total MCs completed display:**

![total MCs Display](images/TotalMCsCompletedDisplay.png)
* Shows the total number of MCs taken, over the user's set MCs goal.
* The total number of MCs taken is calculated from all modules taken before the current semester.
    * For example: If the current semester is year 1 semester 2, the total number of MCs will be calculated
      from all modules taken in year 1 semester 1 only.

**Course requirements display:**

![requirements MCs Display](images/CourseRequirementsDisplay.png)
* Shows the total number of MCs taken for that requirement, over the number of MCs needed to satisfy the requirement.
* The total number of MCs taken for a requirement is calculated from modules taken before the current semester, which have been tagged with the specific tags.
    * For example: MCs for modules taken which are tagged with "ge" (`tag/ge`) will be counted into the total number of MCs taken for the GE requirement.
* Modules with the following tags will be used in calculating the MCs completed for the corresponding requirement:

Requirement | Tag (not case sensitive)
------------|-----------
GE | "ge"
UE | "ue"
Foundation | "foundation"
Breadth and Depth | "breadth and depth"
IT Professionalism | "it professionalism"
Math and Science | "math and science"

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
A module can have more than one tag, but the module will only be included in the calculation of MC requirements if it contains at least one of the tags mentioned above.
</div>

Notes:
* If the MC requirement has been satisfied, the completed MCs and progress bar will be coloured light blue.<br>
![Satisfied MC Requirement](images/SatisfiedMCRequirement.png)  
* If the MC requirement is not satisfied, the completed MCs and progress bar will be coloured pink.<br>
![Unsatisfied MC Requirement](images/UnsatisfiedMCRequirement.png)

#### 3.2.6 Current Year and Semester
* Displays the current year and semester that the application is in.
* The current year and semester affects the colours of the [modules](#33-module-explanation) in your academic plan.
* The current year and semester also affects your [MC goal progress](#325-mc-goal-progress).
* You can use the [set](#423-setting-users-mc-goal-or-current-semester--set) command to update the current year and semester that the application is in.

#### 3.2.7 Current MC goal
* Displays your current [MC goal](#mcgoal).
* Your MC goal can be edited using the [set](#423-setting-users-mc-goal-or-current-semester--set) command.

### 3.3 Module Explanation
Here is an image of a module in our [database](#database)<br>
![Module Explanation](images/ModuleExplanation.png)

A module is made up of 6 **components**:
1. An [index](#index) in the database
1. A module [code](#code) number
1. A [title](#title) 
1. A [description](#description) of the module
1. The number of [MC](#mc) that the module carries 
1. The [tag(s)](#tag) that the module can be classified under

A module can have 4 different colour codes:
* A grey coloured module represents a module that is in the database but not in your [academic plan](#academic-plan)<br>
  ![Default Module](images/ModuleExplanation.png)

* A green coloured module represents a module that is in your academic plan and you have taken the module previously<br>
  For example, if you are currently in Year 2 Semester 1, a module in Year 1 Semester 2 of your academic plan would look like this:<br>
  ![Module taken](images/GreenModule.png)

* A red coloured module represents a module that is in your academic plan and you are planning to take the module in a future year or semester<br>
  For example, if you are currently in Year 1 Semester 1, a module in Year 1 Semester 2 of your academic plan would look like this:<br>
  ![Module taken](images/RedModule.png)

* A yellow coloured module represents a module that is in your academic plan and you are currently taking this module in this semester previously<br>
  For example, if you are currently in Year 1 Semester 2, a module in Year 1 Semester 2 of your academic plan would look like this:<br>
  ![Module taken](images/YellowModule.png)

### 3.4 Command Format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `lower_case` are the inputs to be followed while words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be entered by you.<br>
  e.g. when using our [add command](#411-adding-a-module-into-the-database--add)(`add m/MODULE`),
  you are supposed to type in`add m/` while `MODULE` is a parameter which is entered you(such as `add m/GEQ1000` or `add m/CS2030S`).

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `c/CODE [tag/TAG]` can be used as `c/CS2103T tag/core` or as `c/CS2103T`.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `m/2 m/4`, only `m/4` will be taken.

* Inputs for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## 5. FAQ

This section gives you the solutions to commonly asked questions.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous NUS Module Tracker home folder.

**Q**: If I have a module inside my academic plan and I delete the module from the database using the "delete" command, would the module still appear in my academic plan?<br>
**A**: No, deleting a module from the database removes the module from your academic plan.

**Q**: What should I do if there is a module that I want to add into my academic plan but it is not inside the database?<br>
**A**: First, add the module into the database using the [add](#411-adding-a-module-into-the-database--add) command. Then, you can add the module into your academic plan using the [take](#421-adding-a-module-to-the-academic-plan--take) command.

**Q**: Why is the module not included in the [MC Goal Progress](#325-mc-goal-progress) even though I have added it to my academic plan using the [take](#421-adding-a-module-to-the-academic-plan--take) command<br>
**A**: Make sure that the module has the appropriate tag. Also make sure that the module is colour coded in green as specified [here](#33-module-explanation). Do remember that our MC Goal Progress only takes into account the modules that you have taken.

**Q**: What should I do if I want to edit my data file directly? <br>
**A**: Your data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/moduletracker.json`, you may directly access the file to edit your data. 
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
Do note that if you edit your data file and NUS Mod Tracker deems it as an invalid data file, your data will be discarded and you will start with the default database modules.
