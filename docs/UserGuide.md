## 1. Introduction


<img alt="DonnaFinLogo" src="./images/DonnaFin.png" width="800"/>

DonnaFin.io is a desktop application financial advisors use to keep track of their
client information and related tasks. The '.io' in our name reflects our belief
that you deserve a faster workflow for input and output. If you can type fast,
you can use our [CLI-like](#7-glossary) commands to manage your client information
and view your notes much faster than your typical customer relationship management apps.

Note: From here on, we shall refer to DonnaFin.io as DonnaFin for your readability.

### 1.1 Is this guide for you?

Are you a new user who is looking to get started with using DonnaFin? Perhaps you are a more
advanced user trying to refresh your understanding of the available commands? Look no further!
This guide will kickstart your journey as a DonnaFin whizz and even be your go-to
reference if you need to refresh your understanding of some features.
Head over to [Quick Start](#2-quick-start) or [Features](#4-features) for more information.

### 1.2 How to use the user guide

As most applications on the market are not CLI-based, this may be
new to some users. We strongly recommend that first-time users read through the user guide to gain a basic understanding
of how to use our app. We have also included links to navigate around the user guide to allow easier access
to related information. This guide includes some tips and tricks, and cautions to
help you get more out of our application. Additionally, links back to the top of the page
like below are present at the end of every section. For easier navigation around this User Guide, we suggest using our table of contents together with these
links to find and access the information you need quickly.

## 2. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.

1. Download the latest `donnafin.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your DonnaFin app. Using an empty folder is
   recommended to reduce confusion and conflict between data and user preference generated by our application.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note
   that DonnaFin comes with some sample clients.<br> ![Ui](images/UiMain.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all clients.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a client named `John Doe` to the DonnaFin.

   * **`view`**`3` : Opens the client window, where you can access the details of the 3rd client shown in the current list.

   * **`tab`**`a` : Access the assets tab of the client that is currently viewed.

   * **`append`**`n/Good Class Bungalow ty/Property v/$10000000 r/newly bought with bank loan` :
   As we are in the Asset tab now, this will add an asset to the currently viewed client.
   * **`remove`**`1` : Removes the 1st asset in the Asset tab.

   * **`home`** : Return to the home window.

   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd client shown in the current list.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the DonnaFin.

1. Refer to the [Features](#4-features) below for details of each command.

</div><br>

### 3.2 Application Home Window Breakdown

Here is an overview of the different elements that make up the Home Window of DonnaFin

![Main Window.png](./images/MainWindowScreenshot.png)

#### 3.2.1 Quick Access Buttons
* This area gives you access to the 'File' button that allows you to quickly exit the app. The help
  button redirects you to the User Guide for further guidance.

#### 3.2.2 Command Box
* The command box is where you can enter a command where you can hit enter to execute it.

#### 3.2.3 Result Display
* The result display is where the response to the command entered is displayed.
* If you enter an invalid or wrongly formatted command, the error message will be displayed here as well.

#### 3.2.4 Client List Panel
In this section, you will view a list of all the clients that have their records stored on DonnaFin. The index
of a client corresponds to the index needed to be entered in the `view` command. For example: if the client list is as
per the image above, entering the input `view 2` will take you to the client window of Bernice Yu, as she has the index
of 2.

The following client details are also viewable from the Client List Window:
1. Name
2. Phone
3. Address
4. Email Address

### 3.3 Application Client Window Breakdown

Using the `view` command brings you to the client window. Though the client window differs in content and layout
from the main window, the 'Quick Access Button', 'Command Box', and 'Result Display' are all the same, as explained
earlier in section 3.2.

Here is a picture showing all the common elements spread across all tabs in the Client View.

![Client View](images/ClientView.png)

#### 3.3.1 Client Tab Buttons
* These buttons are specific to the Client Window. You can use these buttons to toggle through the different tabs
  to access and edit client information. The tabs are as follows:
  1. Contact
  2. Policies
  3. Assets
  4. Liabilities
  5. Notes

You can toggle through the tabs using the `tab` command as shown [here](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w16-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#431-switching-tabs-in-client-window-tab).

#### 3.3.2 Contact Tab
The Contact Tab is the Client Window tab you first see when transitioning from the Home View to the Client View.
Alternatively, this tab can also be accessed by pressing on the `Contact` button when in any of the Client View tabs
or typing the command `tab c`, `tab contact` or `tab contacts`. You can access the following contact details of
your client:
1. Name
2. Phone
3. Email
4. Address

The picture below shows how these are displayed:

![ClientContactTab](images/ClientContactTab.png)

The Contact tab also supports the `edit` that allows you to change your client's contact details, as
shown [here.](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w16-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#432-edit-clients-contact-information-edit)

#### 3.3.3 Policies Tab
The Policies Tab is the Client View tab that stores all of your client's policies. This tab could be accessed by pressing on
the **Policies** button when in any of the Client View tabs or typing the command `tab p`, `tab policy` or `tab policies`.

You will know that you are in the Policy tab if you see the **Policies** header below the Result Display. You can access the total
commission you earned through looking at the number to the right of the **Total Policy Commissions**.

The table displays each policy in its row, with each policy field (e.g. insurer, commission) displayed in columns.

![PolicyTab](images/PolicyTab.png)

Here are the following fields that each policy records:
1. Policy Name
2. Insurer
3. Insured Value
4. Yearly Premium
5. Commission

Each policy has an index that is sorted by ascending order. If you would like to remove an existing policy, you can
use its index as a parameter for `delete`. To save you the effort of counting rows, we have indexed the rows with a counter
on the leftmost column.


The Policies tab also supports the `append` and `remove` command that allows you to add a new policy or
remove an existing policy, as shown
[here](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w16-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#435-policy-features).

#### 3.3.4 Asset/Liabilities Tab

###### This section covers both the asset and liability tab due to their similarities.

The Asset/Liabilities tab is the Client View tab that stores all of your client's assets/liabilities. This tab can be
accessed by pressing on the `Assets/Liabilities` button when in any of the Client View tabs or typing the
command `tab a`, `tab asset`, or `tab assets` for the Assets tab and typing the command `tab l`, `tab liability`, or
`tab liabilities` for the Liabilities tab.

You will know that you are in the Assets tab if you see the **Assets** header below the Result Display or the
Liabilities tab if you see the **Liabilities** header below the Result Display. You can see the total value of these
assets/liabilities by looking at the number beside the **Total Asset/Liability Value**.

The table displays each asset/liability in a row with each field of the asset/liability displayed in columns.

![Asset/Liabilities Tab of DonnaFin](images/Asset_Liability.png)

Here are the following fields that each asset/liability records:
1. Index
2. Asset/Liability Name
3. Asset/Liability Type
4. Asset/Liability Value
5. Remarks

Each asset/liability has an index that is sorted by ascending order. If you would like to remove an existing
asset/liability, you can use its index as a parameter for `delete`. To save you the effort of counting rows, we have
indexed the rows with a counter on the leftmost column.

The Asset/Liability tab also supports the `append` and `remove` command that allows you to add a new asset/liability or
remove an existing asset/liability as shown [here](#4331-add-an-asset-to-a-client-append).

#### 3.3.5 Notes Tab

The Notes tab stores additional information about your client. You can access this tab by pressing on the `Notes`
button when in any of the Client View tabs or typing the command `tab n`, `tab note` or `tab notes`.

You will know that you are in the Notes tab if you see a big white text box below the Result Display. You may simply
type into it, and you will save all the edits you make. Unlike the command box, this supports multi-line input and
allows you to indent lines with spaces.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source:
**Note:**
A discerning user may notice that Notes stands out from all the other tabs. Unlike other fields, Notes support
multi-line input. As you may write at length in these multi-line fields, we deemed that force-fitting your note-taking
workflow through a single-line command input would be counter-productive and unintuitive.
</div>

![Notes Tab of DonnaFin](images/Notes.png)

### 3.4 Command Format

In DonnaFin, we provide the user with a Command-Line-Input (or CLI). The command message is generally in the format of a
`COMMAND_WORD` followed optionally by a number of parameters (`COMMAND_WORD PARAMETER1 PARAMETER2 PARAMETER3`).

The `COMMAND_WORD` directly describes the intent (e.g. `add`, `delete`, `view`).
The optional parameters are additional information that the command may require. For example, `delete` requires
one parameter — the index of the client being listed, so the full command would be `delete 1`

Command syntax takes these three possible forms:

* Commands that do not require parameters (e.g. `list`, `home`)
* Commands that require 1 parameter (e.g. `view 1`, `delete 1`, `find pat`)
* Commands that require more than 1 parameter. In these cases, parameters must always be prefixed and order does not
  matter. (e.g. `add n/John McClane e/mcclane@notnakatomi.com a/3 Mountain View Rd, SG 244220 p/90249024`)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Command word is **case-insensitive**.<br>
  e.g. in `remove 3`, command word `remove` can be accepted as `Remove` or `rEmOvE`.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `edit n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `edit n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* To make things easier to remember for the user, we have also chosen prefixes that closely resemble the field to be
  added to (e.g. `n/` for name and `pr/` for premium).

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` can be used as `KEYWORD MORE_KEYWORDS` or as `KEYWORD`.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence
  of the parameter will be taken.<br> e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* The format given for monetary parameters includes `$`, you should add it or the input will be rejected. <br>
  e.g. A valid input for `v/$ASSET_VALUE` is `v/$1000`. `v/1000` will not be accepted by DonnaFin. As we currently
  only accept dollar formats, cents can be added by specifying the value to two decimal points.

## 4. Features

This section gives you a detailed explanation of how each of our features works.

For your easy reference and navigation, we have split our features into _four different categories_:
1. [Global Features](#41-global)
2. [Home Window Features](#42-home-window)
3. [Client Window Features](#43-client-window)
4. [Database Features](#44-database)

The following categories will explain the intended purpose of our features.

### 4.1 Global
Global commands consist of features that you can access from any (Home or Client) window of DonnaFin.
Such features include getting help and exiting DonnaFin.

#### 4.1.1 Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

<img alt="help message" src="./images/helpMessage.png" width="1232"/>

Format: `help`

#### 4.1.2 Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### 4.2 Home Window

Home Window commands consist of features that enable you to manage your client base.
These features are exclusive to [Home Window](#32-application-home-window-breakdown), the default window that pops up when DonnaFin opens.

**The Home Window:**
![home window](images/Ui.png)

Such features include adding and deleting clients, listing/clearing all clients, doing a specific search for clients,
as well as viewing a client in detail.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:information_source: **Note:**
To access and update details on a specific client, you may refer to [Client Window Commands](#43-client-window).
</div>

#### 4.2.1 Adding a Client : `add`

Adds a client to the DonnaFin.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS`

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567`

Do take note that there is a near-duplicate check for names. This means that when
adding a person whose name is similar to another client already found in DonnaFin,
the result display will prompt the user as shown below but the client will still be added to
the client list. However, if the names are exact duplicates, they will be rejected.

Near-duplicate:
![DuplicateRejectionMessage](images/NearDuplicateRejectionMessage.png)

Duplicate:
![FullDuplicateRejectionMessage](./images/FullDuplicateRejectionMessage.png)

Names are said to be near-duplicates  if the names differ only in case
(upper case letters where there are lower case letters) or
with spaces (user types in two or more spaces in place of one)

| First Name     | Second Name                        | Is near-duplicate
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| david Li     | David LI                        | yes
| daviD Li     | David LI                        | yes
| daVid Li     | David LI                        | yes
| david Li     | David    &nbsp; LI                        | yes
| david Li     | David     &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;     LI              | yes
| davidLi     | David Li                        | no
| DavidLi     | David Li                        | no

Note that this duplicate detection does not try to combine separated words.
E.g. 'John Son' and 'Johnson' would not be seen as near-duplicates.

#### 4.2.2 Deleting a Client : `delete`

</div><br>

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`

Format: `append n/POLICY_NAME i/INSURER iv/$INSURED_VALUE pr/$YEARLY_PREMIUM c/$COMMISSION`

Example:
* `append n/Diamond Policy i/AIA iv/$10000 pr/$200 c/$1000`

##### 4.3.5.2 Remove a Policy from a Client: `remove`

Remove an existing policy from the current client you are viewing. You must be in the `Policies` tab.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:**
The index reference can be taken from the number on the leftmost column!
</div>

* Removes the liability at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed policy list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Format: `remove INDEX`

Example:
* `remove 1`

#### 4.3.6 Edit Notes

You can simply add your changes inside the notes field inside the `Notes` tab, and DonnaFin will automatically save your data.

#### 4.3.7 Returning to Home Window: `home`

Allows the user to return to the home window.

Format: `home`

### 4.4 Database

Database features consist of features that are related to how your client data is stored.

#### 4.4.1 Saving the data

DonnaFin data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### 4.4.2 Editing the data file

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If your changes to the data file are erroneous and cause DonnaFin to "lose its data".
Don't worry, as long as you do not run commands, your data is still stored. Simply undo your changes to restore.
</div>

DonnaFin's data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/donnafin.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**

If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, DonnaFin will discard all data and start with
an empty data file on the next run (no clients are shown).

``` YAML
{
  "persons" : [ {
    "name" : "Alex Yeoh",
    "phone" : "87438807",
    "email" : "alexyeoh@example.com",
    "address" : "Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40",
    "notes" : "Likes bread",
    "policies" : [ {
      "name" : "Golden Age",
      "insurer" : "AIA",
      "totalValueInsured" : "  14000.00", // note the invalid monetary format
      "yearlyPremiums" : "$ 28.00",
      "commission" : "$ 4.00"
    } ],
  } ]
}
```

The above figure shows the original JSON data for `totalValueInsured`
regarding the client Alex Yeoh. Suppose you tamper with the
JSON file directly and change one of client details to an invalid format (in this case the
total value of assets is supposed to be start with a '$' to indicate that it is a monetary value). DonnaFin will
start with an empty data file.

However, when this happens, to prevent total loss of your data, **we do not delete it right away**.
DonnaFin will assume that the intended action is to clear your data and restart only when **any** valid command is run.
DonnaFin will then proceed to cleanly wipe donnafin.json and execute your command.

## 5. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
       the data of your previous DonnaFin home folder.

**Q**: I have multiple clients with the same name, but your application won't let me add them! What do I do?<br>
**A**: We realize some names are common, but we decided to prioritize your ability to instantly recognize a client
       over letting you keep the accuracy of the name. For that reason, we suggest adding other identifying nicknames
       or words in the name e.g. "John Walker (Bartender)" and "John Walker (Johnny)".

**Q**: My clients have assets and policies valued in USD / RMB / AUD / other currency. How can I show this in the table?<br>
**A**: We plan to have multi-currency support in future developments. However, currently, we only accept dollar ('$')
       currencies and formats compatible with the Singapore Dollar. For now, please use only a single currency
       and convert as appropriate.

**Q**: I want to write with non-Latin alphabets. Do you have support for internationalization (e.g. Chinese, Hindi, Malay)<br>
**A**: While it may not break our system, we have developed this application with Latin script in mind, and cannot guarantee a
       bug-free experience.
