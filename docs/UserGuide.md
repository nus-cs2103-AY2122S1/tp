## 1. Introduction

NurseyBook is a **desktop app made for nurses in nursing homes to aid them in managing contacts and tasks in their busy lives. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still **having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface** (GUI). If you can type fast, NurseyBook can help you manage your contacts & tasks faster than traditional GUI apps! :smile:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 2. Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `nurseybook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your NurseyBook.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`viewElderly`** : Lists all elderly contacts.

   * **`viewTasks`** : Lists all tasks.

   * **`addElderly`**` en/John a/77 g/M r/420 t/diabetes` : Adds an elderly named `John`.

   * **`deleteElderly`**` 3` : Deletes the records of the 3rd elderly shown in the current list.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

Refer to the [4. Features](#4-features) below for in-depth details of all available commands.

The next section, documents the main features that **NurseyBook** offers and provides you with instructions on how to
use each one of them!
### 3.2 Reading this document

This subsection will introduce to you the symbols, syntax and technical terms that are used throughout this guide.
Being familiar with this subsection will definitely help you out when looking through this guide.

</div>

#### 3.2.2 Sections of the Application Window

You can refer to the image below for the names of the different sections in NurseyBook's application window.

![nurseybook_application_window](images/userGuide/application_window.png)

#### 3.2.3 Navigating in NurseyBook

In NurseyBook, some buttons are clickable - such as the File and Help buttons at the top of the application window.
However, the User Interface (UI) is designed primarily to be navigated using the Command Line Interface (CLI).

You can enter commands into the command box and press `Enter` to execute them. The result box will then provide a response on whether the command was successfully executed.
The display panel will similarly update itself, based on the command executed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.2.4 Command Format

Words that are highlighted in gray (also known as a mark-up) indicates that they are commands that you can type into the command box, and executed by the application.
e.g. `viewTasks`

Commands in this guide follow such rules:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `addElderly en/ELDERLY_NAME`, `ELDERLY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addElderly en/Swee Choon`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `en/ELDERLY_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `en/Swee Choon t/vegan` or as `en/Swee Choon`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `en/ELDERLY_NAME p/NOK_PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/NOK_PHONE_NUMBER en/ELDERLY_NAME` is also acceptable.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Information:**

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Commands that do not take in parameters (such as `viewElderly`, `viewTasks`, `clear`, `help`, `exit`) will ignore the additional parameters that are added to the back of it.
  e.g. if the command specifies `viewTasks 123`, it will be interpreted as `viewTasks`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**

* The _User Interface_ refers to the NurseyBook application window.
* _Command Line Interface_ refers to where you interact with the system by typing in commands - in this case, the command box.
* _Parameters_ refer to the information to be included as an input to a command.

* Undo-ing a `deleteElderly` or an `editElderly` command would restore the elderly's name in relevant tasks but the order of names may be different.

</div>

#### 4.3.4 Redo previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the previous `undo` command executed on the NurseyBook.

Format: `redo`

Example:
* `deleteElderly 1` followed by `undo` causes the `deleteElderly 1` command to be undone and no elderly is deleted from the NurseyBook.
  Entering `redo` will reverse the previous undo command, causing the elderly to be deleted again.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Information:**

* If there are no undo commands executed previously, the redo command will fail and an error message will be shown.
* Redo-ing an `editElderly` command would restore the elderly's name in relevant tasks but the order of names may be different.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 5. Storage

### 5.1 Saving the data

NurseyBook's data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### 5.2 Editing the data file

NurseyBook data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/nurseybook.json`. If you are technologically savvy, you
are also welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**
* If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NurseyBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
* This includes:
  * adding non-existent elderly names to tasks,
  * adding elderly names in a different case to tasks (e.g. Elderly `Khong Guan` within elderlies but a task's elderly names contain `khong guan`),
  * failing to remove/edit all instances of an elderly name you have deleted/edited within the tasks.
