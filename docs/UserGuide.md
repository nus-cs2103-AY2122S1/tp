## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ``(i.e. 0 times),`t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Parameters must be provided exactly.

    - Each parameter is expected only once in the command. If you specified it multiple times,
      an error message will be shown.

    - If an extraneous parameter is specified, an error message will be shown. (Does not apply for tags or contacts)

    - Parameter or argument values cannot contain the character `/`. An error message will be shown if `/` is present in the argument value. For example, `task add 1/2` is invalid, and can be replaced with valid alternatives such as `task add 1 or 2` instead.

</div>

### Notable command prefix formats

Some prefixes require the user to follow certain formats in their commands.

| **Prefix**  | **Use** | **Format** |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `ts`  | Timestamp, represents a date  | `DD`-`MM`-`YYYY` <br/><br/> 1. Single-digit dates or months require a `0` appended at the front. For example, 3rd July 2021 is represented as `03-07-2021`. <br/><br/> 2. The day, month and year are separated by hyphens. |
| `e`  | Email  | `local-part@domain` <br/><br/> 1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.<br/><br/>2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods. <br/><br/> The domain name must: <br/>     - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long <br/> - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters <br/> - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any. |
| `p` | Phone | 1. Phone number provided must contain only numbers and must be at least 3 digits long. |
