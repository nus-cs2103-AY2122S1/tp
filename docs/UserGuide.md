Welcome and thank you for downloading **FAST**! Are you a financial advisor having troubles managing your contacts
on your phone? Do you find existing contact management software troublesome and not intuitive to use? Do you want
a free alternative compared to those paid contact management software? If you answered "YES!" to any those questions,
then FAST is for you!

FAST stands for Financial Advisor Smart Tracker (FAST), and as its name implies, we strive to be the fastest, and most
efficient when it comes to managing your contacts.
FAST is a **free and open-source desktop app for Financial Advisors to manage their contacts.**
More importantly, FAST is **optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line
Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you are a Financial Advisor that can type fast, FAST will get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps!

Following that, we have the _Client information_ cards. Each client is represented by a card, which contains
all the information of that client. <br><br>
Lastly, the _Command box_ is where you can type in all your commands!

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## **Features**

### **Command Format**
*All* the commands used in FAST application follows these notations!

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be added in by the user.<br>
  * e.g. for `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is where you would replace it with the actual client's name such as in `add n/John Doe`.


* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  * e.g. if you see `n/NAME [t/TAG]`, this can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.


* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.<br>
  * e.g. if you see`[t/TAG]…​`, it can be `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` or just left empty.


* Parameters can be in any order. (This excludes parameters without a prefix.) <br>
    * e.g. if the command uses this format: `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, you can also input `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`.
  

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>
* Parameter without a prefix **must** be the **first** parameter in the command (when required).


* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the
  last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
    * e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.


* For commands that do not take in any parameter (such as  `list`, `exit` and `clear`), anything written after
  the command will be ignored.<br>
    * e.g. if you input `help 123`, it will simply be interpreted as `help`.


* If a command expects a specific set of parameters, and you entered *extra* parameter into the command (with unrecognised),
prefix, then FAST will assume it to be part of the previous parameter input, which may or may not be valid for certain commands. <br>
    * e.g. if a command expects this parameter `ea v/New York` but you enter `ea v/New York p/87657654`, 
  FAST will assume your input to `v/` to be `New York p/87657654`.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Parameters refer to the details that are to be included as an input to a command. <br>
Prefix refers to the word symbol used before the parameter. 
</div>

<br>

### **Command Parameters**
In this subsection, you can see all the parameters used in FAST at one place. These parameters are used for

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**

</div>

<br>

#### Tags

You can use our Tagging system to label and categorise your clients.
Tags are a quick way for you to organise your contacts, and recall their key characteristics.
In FAST, we have three main types of tags:

![tagOverview](images/tags_overview.png)

1. Normal tags, which you can customise according to your needs.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
    Tags should be used to categorise clients; use short names for normal tags that you may be able to use for other clients as well!
    </div>

2. Priority tags, which have fixed names and help you to remember which contacts you need to focus on first.
   
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
    A client can **only have 1 priority tag** , but they can have other non-priority tags alongside the one priority tag.
    </div>

3. Investment plan tags, which help you recall the plans that each contact has bought.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
    A client can have more than 1 investment plan tag, but they may not have more than 1 of the same investment plan tag.
    
    For example, a client may have both Savings and Investment concurrently, but not 2 instances of Savings at the same time. 
    </div>

<br>

##### Tag Naming Conventions

You can refer to the table below to quickly learn about how to use these three tags.

Tag type|Prefix|Term
--------|-------|-----
Normal|`No Prefix`| Your preferred tag name, that contains at most 20 alphanumeric characters and no spaces
Priority|`pr/`| `low`: Low Priority<br>`med`:Medium Priority<br>`high`:High Priority
Investment plan|`ip/`| `health`: Health Insurance<br>`invest`: Investment<br>`life`: Life Insurance<br>`motor`: Motor Insurance<br>`property`: Property Insurance <br>`save`: Savings <br>`travel`: Travel Insurance

In general, append the term to the prefix when referring to a priority or investment plan tag.
Normal tags do not have prefixes, so simply type in the desired tag name.

More examples of how to use these will be given in the following section.

<br>

##### Using tags: `tag`

You can add or delete the tags of a specified client. 

**Format**: `tag INDEX [a/TAG] [d/TAG]`
* Use `a/` to add a tag, and `d/` to delete a tag.
* To add Priority or Investment Plan Tags, remember to add their prefixes!
* Does not affect any unmentioned tags, unlike `edit`.
* Delete operations are performed first before add operations, regardless of their order in the input.
