SalesNote is a **desktop app for tailors, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI), suitable for fast
typists. SalesNote aims to help tailors simplify their administrative tasks, with the main features split between helping to manage:
* Client Information (e.g. Contact details, measurements, notes)
* Tasks to be done 
* Sales orders and accounts

This is a user guide aimed at helping all users of SalesNote; both new and experienced. The table of contents 
below lists all the available commands, and each link will bring you to a quick overview for more information on the
given command. Newer users hoping to quickly get started can refer to the "quick start", in the first section of the
user guide below.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below to learn more about the commands.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>
Here are some general notes for you to aid in understanding the documentation below. It includes examples 
to help you better understand how the documentation translates to actual commands you can key into SalesNote.

* In the documentation, words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters you should supply. Some examples include:
    * In `addclient n/NAME ...`, `NAME` should be replaced by a name of your choice. e.g. `addclient n/Jacob Tan ...`
    * In `deletetask INDEX`, `INDEX` should be replaced by a positive number. e,g, `deletetask 2`

* When the documentation surrounds parameters with square brackets, this indicates they are optional and can be left blank.
    * The format for `addtask` is:
        * `addtask l/LABEL d/DATE [t/TASKTAG]`
    * So in this case, you can use the command with or without supplying a `TASKTAG`. The following are both valid:
        * `addtask l/Sew Buttons d/20th Aug 2021`
        * `addtask l/Sew Buttons d/20th Aug 2021 t/SO1`

* To add on to the previous point, some arguments have a `…​` after them, e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` in the `addclient` command.
  This is to indicate that the arguments may be used 0 or more times, for instance the following are all valid:
    * `addclient n/Jacob Tan p/98765432 e/jtan@gmail.com a/47 Cashew Road m/170-70-70 g/M t/Regular t/Important`
    * `addclient n/Jacob Tan p/98765432 e/jtan@gmail.com a/47 Cashew Road m/170-70-70 g/M t/Regular`
    * `addclient n/Jacob Tan p/98765432 e/jtan@gmail.com a/47 Cashew Road m/170-70-70 g/M`

* The parameters you give an argument can be in any order </br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

This command will bring up the following window, allowing you to access this user guide at any time.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

## Client Commands

These commands relate to helping you record and manage client information using SalesNote. When entering a client's
information into the application, there are several fields of information you can store, such as the client's gender,
or their body measurements for clothing.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the client commands:**<br>

* SalesNote allows you to record the gender of the client. The gender field takes accepts "M" or "Male" to
  indicate male gender, and "F" or "Female" to indicate female gender. Note that this ignores case, thus "male" or "FEMALE" will also be accepted.
* A related point, is that SalesNote also allows you to store their measurements for easy reference. This field
  is **different depending on their gender**. Take note of the following points:
    * A male's body measurements should be of the format height_waist_shoulder in cm, and it should not be blank.
    * A female's body measurements should be of the format height_waist_shoulder_bust in cm, and it should not be blank.
* A phone number is to consist only of numbers, and be between 3 and 20 digits long
* An email should be of the form `LOCALPART@DOMAIN` and follow the following rules:
    1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
    2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
       The domain name must:
        - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
        - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
        - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.
* The tag field is meant to help categorise your clients: it should consist of a single block of alphanumeric characters. Some examples of valid tags:
    * `t/regular` (trailing and leading spaces are allowed and will be removed, so "t/ friends" and "t/friends  " have the same result)
    * `t/cat1` (numbers are allowed)
    * Note that `t/regular friend` fails however
* The remark field is a free-form field that allows you to keep short notes. e.g. `r/broad shoulders`

</div>

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Adding a client : `addclient` 

Format: `addclient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS m/MEASUREMENT g/GENDER [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]…​`

Allows you to add a client to SalesNote. 

Note that the application maintains a list of unique individuals! In this case two individuals are **considered equal if
they have the same name**. Two individuals having the exact same name is quite the rare occurrence, and so we felt
this was more likely to be a mistake we wanted to help prevent. If you do happen to have two clients with the
exact same name, our recommendation is to add a number, to make clear that this was intentional (e.g. adding Jane Lim
and Jane Lim1).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If you get the required format for a field wrong e.g. you key in an invalid EMAIL, the command will fail and SalesNote will 
give you a warning, and a reminder of the requirements:
</div>

![add client tip](images/uiupdate/addclienttip.png)

Some examples of valid commands:
* `addclient n/Ng Chin Gan p/98765432 e/ncg@example.com a/42 Almond Street g/M m/170_100_40`
* `addclient n/Alice Seah e/aseah@example.com a/47 Cashew Street p/92345782 t/important g/F m/160_85_35_81`

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Deleting a client : `deleteclient`

Format: `deleteclient INDEX`

Allows you to delete a client from SalesNote.

* Deletes the client at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed **Clients** tab list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* Using `listclients` first, to display all clients in SalesNote followed by `deleteclient 2` will 
  delete the 2nd client in the displayed list.
* Using `findclient Alice` first, followed by `deleteclient 1` will delete the 1st client in the results of the `findclient` command.
  </br> This is a quick and convenient way to remove a specific client that you know is in SalesNote, without 
  having to scroll to find them.

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Editing a client : `editclient`

Format: `editclient INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [m/MEASUREMENT] [g/GENDER] [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]…​`

Edits an existing client in SalesNote.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
Editing the gender of a customer is something we expect to be quite rare. Nevertheless, if you find yourself needing to
do so, do not forget to also edit their body measurements when you change their gender! As a reminder, the measurements
SalesNote requires are different depending on the gender of the client.
</div>

* Edits the client at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* **At least one of the optional fields must be provided.** 
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the client will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative. In particular, this means
  </br> that if you want to keep all existing tags, and add a new one, you should re-type all the tags in the command.
    * e.g. Suppose the first displayed client already has the tag `friend`, and you wish to add the tag `regular`. The 
      command is then: </br> `editclient 1 t/friend t/regular`
* You can remove all the client’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `editclient 1 p/91234567 e/jacobtan@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st client to be `91234567` and `jaconbtan@example.com` respectively.
*  `editclient 2 n/Jamie Chew t/` Edits the name of the 2nd client to be `Jamie Chew` and clears all existing tags.

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Locating clients by name : `findclient`

Format: `findclient KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Allows you to find clients whose names contain any of the given keywords.

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `chan` will match `Chan`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Jane Lim` will match `Lim Jane`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Jan` will not match `Jane`
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned, for instance searching `Jane Tay` will return `Jane Tan`, `Alice Tay`

Examples:
* `findclient jacob` can return `Jacob Chua` and `Jacob Tan`
* `findclient alex david` can return `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li`

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Listing all clients : `listclients`

Format: `listclients`

Displays a list of all clients in SalesNote to you. 

One common use of this command is to remove a filter. For instance you might have used `findclient tan` to display only clients
whose names contain "Tan". Following with the command `listclients` allows you to refresh the client list to display all clients currently in SalesNote.

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Order Commands
These commands are for helping you to manage your incoming orders and manage accounts with SalesNote. Orders are created
with a label describing them, a client, an amount, and a date. The following are a few points to take note of:

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the order commands:**<br>

* The amount field is any number from 0 to 1 billion.
* The client for the order **must exist in SalesNote** to create the order. For instance <br>
  `addorder l/blue blouse c/Jane a/22.50 d/20 August 2021` will fail if the client with name `Jane` is not in SalesNote. Note that the name is matched
  **regardless of capitalisation!** So if you have a client named `James`, your order can be addressed to `james`, `JAMES`, `James` and so on.
* Editing a client, will also edit all the orders tied to the client. For instance, if a client's name is changed from
  "Alice" to "Alice Lin", all orders addressed to "Alice" will now be addressed to "Alice Lin". 
* The date field should follow one of the following formats. Note that the field is case-insensitive (e.g. 08 NOV 2021 would also work):

  Format | Example
      --------|------------------
  **dd mmmm yyyy** | `08 November 2001`
  **dd mmm yyyy** | `08 Nov 2021`
  **yyyy mm dd** | `2021 11 08`
  **dd-mm-yyyy** | `08-11-2021`
  **yyyy/mm/dd** | `2021/11/08`
  **dd/mm/yyyy** | `08/11/2021`
  
* Note that there is **no enforcement on preventing dates in the past**. The field is simply to allow you to provide a reminder
  for yourself.
</div>

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Adding an order : `addorder` 

Format: `addorder l/LABEL c/CUSTOMER a/AMOUNT d/DATE`

Allows you to add an order to SalesNote. Note that SalesNote maintains a unique list of orders. Orders are considered the same if
they have the same **label and customer**. So:

* `addorder l/blue blouse c/Alice a/21.00 d/20 August 2021` followed by
  
* `addorder l/blue blouse c/alice a/100 d/21 August 2021`

will not be allowed. This is to help guard against user error. If you are sure this is what you want, our suggestion is to add a number at the end of the order label
e.g. `addorder l/blue blouse1 c/alice a/100 d/21 August 2021` instead.

Examples:
* `addorder l/blue blouse c/Alice a/21.90 d/20 August 2021`
* `addorder l/school uniform c/John a/15.00 d/15 October 2021`

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Deleting an order : `deleteorder`

Format: `deleteorder INDEX`

Allows you to delete an order from SalesNote.

* Deletes the order at the specified `INDEX`
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed order list.
* The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3

Note that this will also delete all tasks tagged to the deleted order (for more information, see [Task Commands](#task-commands)).

Examples:
* `listorders` followed by `deleteorder 1` deletes the first listed task in SalesNote
* `findorders Tan` followed by `deleteorder 1` deletes the first customer with surname "Tan" in SalesNote

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Finding orders by keywords : `findorder`

Format: `findorder KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Searches for orders whose customer, label, date or sales id contain any of the given keywords, and 
displays them to you in the **Orders** tab.

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `green` will match `Green`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Blue Blazer` will match `Blazer Blue`
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `Blazer` will not match `Blazers`
* Orders matching at least one keyword will be returned e.g. `Blue Blazer` can return both `Blue Shirt` and `Black Blazer`.

Examples:
* `findorder blue` returns `blue blazer` and `blue shirt`
* `findorder SO1` returns order with id of `SO1`

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

As the purpose of the order commands in SalesNote are to help you manage accounts better, we offer a more comprehensive
set of commands for viewing and sorting orders, shown here below.

### Listing all orders : `listorders`

Format: `listorders`

Displays a list of all orders in SalesNote to you.

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Listing completed orders : `completedorders`

Format: `completedorders`

Filters the list to show only completed orders to you.

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Listing incomplete orders : `incompleteorders`

Format: `incompleteorders`

Filters the list to show only incomplete orders to you.

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Marking an order as complete : `markorder`

Format: `markorder INDEX`

This command is to mark an order in SalesNote as complete, meant to be used when payment has been received.

* Marks the order at the specified `INDEX` as complete
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed order list.
* The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3

This command can be combined with others for ease of use. Some examples:
* Using `findorder Alice` to find all orders addressed to clients named Alice, followed by `markorder 1` to mark the first such order as complete.
* Using `incompleteorders` to filter the list to show only the orders where payment is outstanding first, to quickly find the 
  correct one to mark as complete when a client is making payment.

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Sorting orders : `sortorders`

Format: `sortorders f/FIELD [o/ORDERING]`

Allows you to sort all orders based on a chosen field and arrangement.

* Your orders are sorted based on the `FIELD` chosen. You may choose between:
    * The Date field, identified with a "d" or "date".
    * The Amount field, identified with an "a" or "amount".
* The direction of the arrangement depends on the `ORDERING`, which is either:
    * Ascending, identified with an "asc" or "ascending".
    * Descending, identified with a "desc" or "descending".
* If the `ORDERING` parameter is not supplied, the list will be sorted in ascending order.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

* Your orders are normally arranged in the sequence they were added.

* When two or more orders have an identical value for the `FIELD` chosen, the normal arrangement is used as a tiebreaker. 
  
* The [`addorder`](#adding-an-order--addorder) and [`listorders`](#listing-all-orders--listorders) commands revert the list to the normal arrangement.

</div>

Examples:

Suppose you had the following order list with four orders:

![sortorders1](images/sortorders1.png)

<figcaption align = "center">In the figure above, SalesNote displays the Orders in the sequence they were added. So
Order 1 was added first, and Order 4 was added last.</figcaption>

<br>

Executing `sortorders f/amount o/asc` sorts the list in ascending order, by their amounts, giving:

![sortorders2](images/sortorders2.png)

<figcaption align = "center">Notice that Order 2 and Order 3 are tied with the same amount. Thus Order 2 is displayed
first, since it was added earlier then Order 3.</figcaption>

<br>

The possible combinations give the following outcomes:
* `sortorders f/date o/descending` sorts your orders in descending order of date (orders with later dates shown first).
* `sortorders f/d o/asc` sorts your orders in ascending order of date (orders with earlier dates shown first).
* `sortorders f/a o/ascending` sorts your orders in ascending order of amount (orders for smaller amounts shown first).
* `sortorders f/amount` sorts your orders in ascending order of amount (orders for smaller amounts shown first).

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Viewing total orders : `totalorders`

Format: `totalorders`

This opens a new window, displaying the total dollar amount of all orders from each client in SalesNote to you.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Press the ESCAPE key to close the total orders window
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source:

* Clients without orders will not be displayed.
* After adding/deleting orders, you might want to run this command again to refresh the window.
</div>

![TotalOrdersWindow](images/TotalOrdersWindow2.png)
<figcaption align = "center">e.g. In the figure above, the application has three clients Ng Chin Gan, Alice Seah,
and Jacob Tan, but Jacob Tan is not shown in the TotalOrders window as there are no orders from him in SalesNote yet</figcaption>


[return to top](#table-of-contents)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task Commands
This part of the user guide concerns commands meant to help you manage tasks. Tasks in SalesNote come with a 
label, and a date representing an intended deadline. Like any good to-do list, SalesNote allows you to mark tasks
as completed, but also provides you with an ability to tag tasks to orders.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the task commands:**<br>

* A task tag is **not** the same as a client tag. While you are free to select any client tag you wish, a task tag should:
    * Be `General` or
    * Have prefix `SO` followed by the id of a sales order. This is how you tag tasks as being related to a given order.
    * Some examples:
        * `addtask sew buttons t/general`
        * `addtask sew buttons t/SO1` (this marks the task, as being related to order 1)
        * `addtask sew buttons` (for convenience, if the tag is omitted, SalesNote will classify the task as "general")
* This gives you a convenient way to group related work. For instance, if an order of interest has id `4`, you can tag all
  relevant tasks `SO4` and later type `findtask SO4` to find all these related tasks. As a reminder, if the order
  should be deleted, SalesNote will automatically remove the tasks tagged to that order for you.
* The number after the 'SO' prefix **must correspond to the id of an existing order**. 
* The date field should follow one of the following formats. Note that the field is case-insensitive (e.g. 08 NOV 2021 would also work):
  
  Format | Example
    --------|------------------
  **dd mmmm yyyy** | `08 November 2001`
  **dd mmm yyyy** | `08 Nov 2021`
  **yyyy mm dd** | `2021 11 08`
  **dd-mm-yyyy** | `08-11-2021`
  **yyyy/mm/dd** | `2021/11/08`
  **dd/mm/yyyy** | `08/11/2021`

* Note that there is **no enforcement on preventing dates in the past**. The field is simply to allow you to provide a reminder
  for yourself.
</div>

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Adding a task : `addtask`

Format: `addtask l/LABEL d/DATE [t/TASKTAG]`

Adds a task to SalesNote. The `TASKTAG` field allows you to relate tasks to orders, to help you better organise your work. Note that SalesNote
maintains a **unique list of tasks.** Tasks are considered the same if they have the **same label and same tag**. In particular, this means that:

* `addtask l/Sew buttons d/20 Aug 2021` and
* `addtask l/Sew buttons d/21 Aug 2021` are considered the same task, and you will be unable to key both in succession.
* Similar in the case with adding clients, this is to guard against user error. If you're sure this is what you want,
the simple solution is again to add a number at the end. e.g. `addtask1 l/Sew buttons d/21 Aug 2021`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
A reminder that for your convenience, a new task will automatically be assigned the 'General' tag if the `TASKTAG` parameter is not supplied.
</div>

Examples:
* `addtask l/sew buttons onto blazer d/20 August 2021 t/SO1` adds the task to SalesNote if there is an order with the id of SO1.
* `addtask l/sew buttons onto blazer d/20 Aug 2021` (the tasktag can be omitted)
* `addtask l/sew buttons onto blazer d/2021/08/18`

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Deleting a task : `deletetask`

Format: `deletetask INDEX`

Lets you delete a specified task from SalesNote.

* The command deletes the task at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list on the **Tasks** tab.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `listtasks` followed by `deletetask 2` deletes the 2nd task in SalesNote.
* `findtask sew` followed by `deletetask 1` deletes the 1st task in the results of the `findtask` command.

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Editing a task : `edittask`

Format: `edittask INDEX [l/LABEL] [d/DATE] [t/TASKTAG]`

Allows you to edit the information of an existing task in SalesNote.

* Edits the task at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list on the **Tasks**'s tab. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* If you attempt to edit the `TASKTAG` field to tie the task to an order, note that the order with that id must exist in SalesNote first.
  <br> e.g. `edittask 2 t/SO2` will fail if there is no order with id 2 in SalesNote.

Examples:
* `edittask 1 l/order cloth d/19 September 2021` edits the label and date of the 1st task to be `order cloth` and `19th September 2021` respectively.
* `edittask 2 t/General` edits the tag of the 2nd task to be `General`

### Finding tasks by keywords : `findtask`

Format: `findtask KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Helps you find tasks whose label, date or task tag contain any of the given keywords.

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `orders` will match `Orders`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Cloth Orders` will match `Orders Cloth`
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `Order` will not match `Orders`
* Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. `Order clothes` will return `Order scissors`, `Sew clothes`.

Examples:
* `findtask buttons` returns `order buttons` and `deliver red buttons`
* `findtask SO1` returns task with task tag of `SO1`

### Saving the data

SalesNote data is saved in the hard disk (As a JSON file) automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

[return to top](#table-of-contents)

### Editing the data file

SalesNote saves each data in a different json file.
- AddressBook (Clients information) : as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
- TaskBook (Tasks information)  : as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/taskBook.json`.
- OrderBook (Sales order information) : as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/orderBook.json`.

Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

_Example usage_

1. Open the JSON file in any of your favorite text editor.
2. Edit the entities in the JSON file as you wish.
3. Re-open SaleNote and changes should be reflected.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: <b>Caution:</b>
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, SalesNote will discard all data related to the incorrectly formatted JSON file and start with an empty data file at the next run.</div>

## Using commands in combinations

One of the most common use patterns we expect you to go through, is using our `findClient`/`findOrder`/`findTask`
to first filter the list to items of interest, before then using other commands. We provide an example here. Suppose you 
started with this list of tasks:

![commandcombination1](images/commandcombination1.png)

Now, perhaps you've just finished a task in August not on the current display, and want to locate it and mark it as complete. 
You can first quickly input `findtask Aug` to get a list of tasks with deadline in August:

![commandcombination2](images/commandcombination2.png)

Now you can easily use `marktask 2` to mark the second task, that was previously not on the viewable list as complete. Finally,
to go back to viewing all tasks and "remove" the filtered view, simply type `listtasks` to get the original list of tasks:

![commandcombination3](images/commandcombination3.png)
