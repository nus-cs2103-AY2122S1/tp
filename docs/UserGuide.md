## Overview

Student insurance agents are often very busy, having to juggle their studies while working. Student Insurance Agent Sales Assistant (SIASA) 
helps these students to easily and quickly organize their contacts and policies, while managing their commissions. 

As students are generally tech-savvy, SIASA **is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application**
for student insurance agents to quickly perform operations. Specifically, the app aids the students' operations by:
* [Managing their contacts (such as potential clients and existing clients)](#contact-management)
* [Managing financial policies that they have sold](#policy-management)
* [Providing insightful statistics](#statistics)
* [Offering helpful querying and sorting functionalities](#querying-and-sorting-functionalities)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start
This section provides instructions to begin using Siasa.
1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. Siasa has been tested on Java `11` and running it on other versions might result in bugs.
2. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/releases) and move it to the folder you wish to use as the home folder for Siasa.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

   Some example commands you can try:
   * `addcontact n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`: Adds a contact named John Doe to the contacts list.
   * `deletecontact 2`: Deletes the 2nd contact shown in the current contact list.
   * `clear`: Deletes all contacts and policies.
   * `exit`: Exits the app.

5. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `allcontact`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

| Annual payments of $1000, indefinitely       | 10           | 100         | 10% * $1000 = $100     | Receives commission of $100 from each of the first 100 payments |
| Annual payments of $1000, 120 total payments | 5            | 5           | 5% * $1000 = $50       | Receives commission of $50 from each of the first 5 payments        |
