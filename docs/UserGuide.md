### How to read Commands in StudyTracker

Throughout the User Guide, you'll see commands to enter into StudyTracker.
Here is how to read the command format:

#### Command Structure

Commands use a multipart structure that must be specified in this order:
1. **Command word** which may be user-created aliases (detailed further in [**Aliases**](#setting-command-aliases)). <br>
2. **Parameters** and **Flags**. A command may have more than one flag and/or parameters.

<img src="images/commandStructure.png" alt="commandStructure" height="300"/>
<br> _Figure 2 - Command Structure_

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Flags

Commands may contain **flags**. All flags are optional.
  Flags are represented by a dash, and a sequence of characters. <br>
  e.g. the `list` command has a `-f` flag to list only favourites.

Here is a list of common flags used.

Flags | Features that support these flags
--------|------------------
Favourite `-f` | `list`
Amenities `-m` | `list`
Rating `-r` | `list`
Tags `-t` | `list`
Override `-o` | `log`
Reset `-r` | `log`
Reset All `-ra` | `log`
Show `-s` | `alias`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
Flags may differ in meaning depending on the command word used. 
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Parameters

* Each parameter may have a delimiter. <br>
e.g. the `NAME` parameter has a delimiter `n/` and the `AMENITY` parameter has a delimiter `m/`.

* You will supply words in `UPPER_CASE` as the parameters.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME*`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/COM1 Basement`.

* You are **required** to enter parameters with an asterisk `*`, while those without an asterisk are 
  optional.<br>
  e.g You can use `n/NAME* m/AMENITY...` as `n/COM1 Basement m/wifi` or as `n/COM1 Basement`.

* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. You can use `t/TAG...​` as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/noisy`, `t/mosquitos t/sunny` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME* a/ADDRESS`, `a/ADDRESS n/NAME*` is also acceptable.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:warning: **Caution:**

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/COM1 n/CLB`, StudyTracker will only take `n/CLB`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here is a list of common delimiters used.

Delimiters | Features that support these delimiters
--------|------------------
Name `n/` | `add`, `edit`, `fav`, `unfav`, `delete`
Spot `spot/` | `edit`
Address `a/` | `add`, `edit`
Operating Hours `o/` | `add`, `edit`
Studied Hours `hr/` | `add`, `log`
Rating `r/` | `add`, `edit`, `list`
Amenity `m/` | `add`, `edit`, `list`
Tag `t/` | `add`, `edit`, `list`

### How to use these Commands in Command Line Interface

If this is your first time using *Command Line Interface (CLI)*, fret not and we will guide you step-by-step on how to use CLI!

You tell the *Command Line Interface* exactly what you want it to do! However, if you input something that the CLI does not understand, 
then the program will not be able to help you. Inputs that the CLI understand are called **valid**, while those that are not understood are
called **invalid**.

Some **valid** user inputs for the [**add command**](#adding-a-study-spot-add) are provided below:
* `add n/PC Commons a/UTown t/veryCrowded m/wifi r/4`
* `add n/COM2 Basement r/3` (optional arguments are not required)
* `add n/TR3 r/4 a/Yusof Ishak House m/wifi m/aircon` (multiple amenities are acceptable)

Some **invalid** user inputs for the [**add command**](#adding-a-study-spot-add) are provided below:
* `add n/PC Commons` (missing `RATING` parameter)
* `add PC Commons /UTown /very crowded /toilet /4*` (delimiters and slashes missing from parameters, unnecessary asterisk added outside of parameters)
* `n/PC Commons a/UTown r/4` (missing command word `add`)

If you accidentally entered a wrong command, don't worry! A comprehensive error message will show up 
in the display immediately to guide you to entering the correct command.

1. In the [**Graphical User Interface Layout**](#gui-layout), the [**Command Box**](#command-box) can be found at the 
   bottom. 
   This is where you will
tell the program what to do.
   
1. Click on the box that says "Enter command here...", and simply type in whatever input you want.

1. Press enter (or click the send button) to submit the command to the program. Remember that the input should be valid! Or else
the program will not know what to do 😢.
   
1. After pressing enter, your command has successfully been given to StudyTracker to be processed! You have just successfully **executed** a command.

Congratulations! 🎉 You should now know how to use CLI. Now all you need to know are the **commands** you can give to the CLI to play around with it.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
Tags, amenities, address and operating hours are all optional.
</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Not sure how to use the Command Line Interface? Check <a 
href="#how-to-use-these-commands-in-command-line-interface">**this**</a> guide out!
</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:warning: **Caution:**
Name cases will be reflected in the interface upon adding, however the name will be case-insensitive in future 
commands for an existing study spot.
Hence you cannot add a StudySpot with the same name and a different case e.g. If "Central Library" is already in StudyTracker,
you cannot add "central library".
</div>

**Examples:** You can try executing the commands in the **input** rows and check if you get the corresponding **output**!

| Input | Output |
|---- |---- |
|`add n/COM1 Basement r/5`| New study spot added: COM1 Basement; Rating: 5|
|`add n/Starbucks at UTown r/4 t/noisy m/wifi o/0800-2000,0900-2200`| New study spot added: Starbucks at UTown; Rating: 4; Operating Hours: Weekdays: 0800-2000, Weekends: 0900-2200; Tags: [noisy]; Amenities: [wifi]|

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Editing a study spot : `edit`

If you made a mistake in your `add` command, or wish to change the details of a study spot due to newly-discovered 
amenities, 
you can easily do so by making use of the `edit` command!

**Format:** `edit spot/NAME* n/NEW_NAME a/NEW_ADDRESS t/NEW_TAG m/NEW_AMENITY r/NEW_RATING o/NEW_OPERATING_HOURS rt/OLD_TAG rm/OLD_AMENITY`

* Edits the study spot matching `NAME`.
  The provided `NAME` is case-insensitive and **must fully match the study spot name**.

* StudyTracker will update the details of the given study spot with any provided `NEW_NAME`, `NEW_ADDRESS`, 
  `NEW_RATING`, `NEW_AMENITY`, `NEW_TAG` and `NEW_OPERATING HOURS`, while removing any provided `OLD_TAG` and 
  `OLD_AMENITY`.
* When editing tags and amenities, using `t/` or `m/` will be adding on top of existing tags and amenities.
* You can remove a specific tag or amenity with the `rt/` or `rm/` parameter respectively.
* You can remove all the study spot’s tags by typing `t/` or `m/` respectively without
  specifying any tags after it.

**Examples:** You can try executing the commands in the **input** rows and check if you get the corresponding **output**!

| Input | Output |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
The above first input and output pair assumes that there is already a study spot named "COM1 Basement" in the Study Tracker!
This input only changes the name from "COM1 Basement" to "Basement". Outputs may differ based on what information 
your original study spot already has. 
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Adding a study spot to Favourites: `fav`

Really enjoyed studying somewhere? You can add this study spot to your favourites by using the `fav` command! This will 
make the Study Spot appear in the [**Favourites List**](#info-display), reminding you of your favourite study spots 
every 
time you open StudyTracker.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
Don't forget to add the spot to your StudyTracker before using the fav command!

### Managing StudyTracker list

#### Listing study spots : `list`

Want to find all the study spots that have the amenity "aircon"? Or perhaps list all the study spots you tagged with 
"freeWater"? You can make use of the `list` command and its various different [**flags**](#flags) to get what you want. 
<br> Note that the results of the `list` command will only contain StudySpots that matches **ALL** the 
specifications provided by the user. 

Below shows the corresponding [**flag**](#flags) to its function.

| Flag     | Function |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| No flag (i.e. `list`)      | Lists out all study spots (clears any filters previously applied)       |
| `-f`   | Shows all favourited study spots        |
| `-t t/TAG...` | Shows all study spots with the specified tags |
| `-m m/AMENITY...` | Shows all study spots with the specified amenities |
| `-r r/RATING` | Shows all study spots with the specified rating |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
You can use multiple flags at once.
</div>

**Examples:** You can try executing the commands in the **input** rows and check if you get the corresponding **output**!

| Input | Output |
|---- |---- |
|`list`|Listed all study spots|
|`list -t t/coffee -m m/wifi -r r/4`|Listed all study spots with Tags: [coffee] with Amenities: [wifi] with Rating: 4|


<img src="images/list_tags_amenities.png" alt="coffee tags wifi amenities rating 4"/>
_Figure 7 - Example of listing study spots with wifi, coffee tag and rating of 4_

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Make use of [**command aliases**](#setting-command-aliases) to speed up typing your inputs!
Default Command alias for `list`: `ls`
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Locating a study spot by name: `find`

Trying to find a study spot by its name? You can use the `find` command to easily do so!

**Format:** `find KEYWORD* MORE_KEYWORDS...`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `library` will match `Library`
* StudyTracker will only match full words. e.g. `Lib` will not match `Library`
* StudyTracker will return study spots matching at least one keyword.
* For example, `find library spot` will match `Central Library` and `Cool Spot` as both the search results for `library` and `spot` are shown.

**Examples:** You can try executing the commands in the **input** rows and check if you get the corresponding 
**output**! Note that the specific number of study spots listed may differ from what you see, depending on what 
study spots you have. 

| Input | Output |
|---- |---- |
|`find library`|2 study spot(s) listed!|

<div markdown="span">[:small_red_triangle: **Back to Top**](#table-of-contents)
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


### Logging study hours: `log`

After studying at a certain study spot, you can `log` how many hours you have studied at this location.
There are also various flags you can use to reset or override hours to the value of your choice.
Use the `-r`, `-o` or `-ra` flags respectively, as shown below:

| Format     | Function |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `log n/NAME* hr/NUM_OF_HOURS*` | Adds the given `NUM_OF_HOURS` to the original studied hours at a study spot |
| `log -o n/NAME* hr/NUM_OF_HOURS*` | Overrides the current studied hours with the given `NUM_OF_HOURS`  |
| `log -r n/NAME*` | Resets the number of studied hours at a study spot to 0 |
| `log -ra` | Resets studied hours of **ALL** study spots to 0 |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
As long as the flag `-ra` is present in the command, hours for all study spots will be reset to 0.  
</div>


**Example:** You can try executing the commands in the **input** rows and check if you get the corresponding **output**!

| Input | Output |
|---- |---- |
|`log n/Starbucks UTown hr/2`|Logged 2 hours at Starbucks UTown!|
|`log -o n/Starbucks UTown hr/5`|Changed hours to 5 at Starbucks UTown!|
|`log -r n/Starbucks UTown`|Reset hours at Starbucks UTown!|
|`log -ra`|Reset hours for all study spots!|

<img src="images/log_hours.png" alt="log hours" />
_Figure 8 - Example of Log command_

Logging 2 hours to 'Starbucks UTown' with the command `log n/starbucks utown hr/2` (as seen in Input 1) would update the **study spot card**, as well as statistics on the **pie chart**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Use the log command at the end of a study session to keep track of how long you studied somewhere!
</div>

### Setting Command Aliases

#### Adding command aliases : `alias` 

Do you find yourself using certain commands so often that you wish you could "code-name" it so you don't need to type so much? 
Alias is the command for you. The `alias` command can help you to shorten input commands to whatever you want it to be. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
Aliases are case-sensitive! 
</div>

| Format     | Function |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `alias -s` | Shows all aliases that you have set |
| `alias al/ALIAS* cmd/COMMAND*` | Sets and alias, where `ALIAS` is the shortcut and `COMMAND` is the given input you wish to alias  |

**Example:** 

| Input     | Output | Usage of Alias | Output |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| `alias al/ml cmd/list` | Added alias ml: [list] | `ml` | `Listed all study spots` |

* running `ml` will run the `list` command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can chain aliases to make more powerful commands! See the below example.<br>
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Example:** <br>

| Input     | Output | Usage of Alias | Output |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| `alias al/LogCLB cmd/log n/Central Library hr/` | Added alias LogCLB: [log n/Central Library hr/] | `LogCLB 3` | `Logged 3 hours at Central Library!`|


Running `LogCLB 3` would then result in `log n/Central Library hr/3`, allowing you to log a variable number of study hours to 'Central Library'!

#### Removing command aliases: `unalias`

If you do not like an alias you originally set, you can use `unalias` to remove that alias.

**Format:** `unalias al/ALIAS*` to remove alias

**Example:**

| Input | Output |
|---- |---- |
|`unalias al/ml`|Removed alias 'ml'|

## **FAQ**

This section contains frequently asked questions (FAQs) about StudyTracker.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty **data** file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous StudyTracker home folder.
You may also copy the **preferences.json** file to keep your user preferences.

**Q**: How should tags be used? <br>
**A**: Tags are short bites of information about study spots. It is up to you to define how you use them. One way is 
to use `list` to filter for study spots with a specified tag. You can refer to [**List**](#listing-study-spots--list) 
for more details.
