**Notor** is a personal CRM, developed for faculty mentors at NUS to manage their mentees. NUS faculty mentors tend to have many mentees who they might not meet often, but they are still expected to understand their mentee's situations and provide useful advice. A personal CRM (CRM stands for Customer Relationship Manager) like Notor is a useful aid to track information and organize information about mentees, which hugely benefits forming meaningful connections. However, Notor can still help people outside our target audience in situations where one must manage **many contacts** and need to **take notes quickly**.

Notor is a desktop application **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type faster than the average typing speed, the CLI is likely faster than alternatives on the market.

Key features of Notor are:

* Powerful Organization to manage many mentees, with powerful user customisation
  * Group mentees, and place groups into subgroups for greater control
  * Add tags to mentees and sort by tags to easily identify metadata about your contacts
  * Archive contacts you are no longer actively mentoring, but keep them in your Notor to retrieve at any time
  * Export data to serve as a backup.
* Clean note-taking system
  * Take notes concurrently with meeting mentees through no-frills text files
  * Drop time stamps whenever you update your information and meet with the mentee effortlessly
* Fast CLI
  * Commands with short forms
  * Works offline for better performance

## Quick Start
### 1. Setup
Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer. You can install Java `11` from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11-windows).
### 2. Installing the project
Download the latest `notor.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/releases), and copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Notor. The *home folder* is where the data that Notor uses will be stored.

### 3. Running the application
Double-click the file to start the application. If you have set up Java `11` correctly, the application should open, and the GUI similar to below should appear in a few seconds.
Note how the app contains some sample data. <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4. Try Running Examples!

Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. Typing **help** and pressing Enter will
open the help window. <br>

If you'd like a guided tour of a few of Notor's features, go to [Appendix: Tutorial](#tutorial) to try Notor out. We recommend this if you have never used Notor before.

Otherwise, you can jump right into it! Here are a few other commands you can try:

* `person /list` : Lists all contacts.
* `person 3 /delete` : Deletes the 3rd contact (contact with index number 3) shown in the current list.
* `person User /create` : Creates a person named User.
* `group Orbital /create` : Creates a group named Orbital.
* `person 3 /add g:Orbital` : Adds the person with index 3 to the group Orbital.
* `group /list` : Lists all groups.
* `group 1 /note` : Edits the group note for the group with index number 1.
* `group 1 /create n:Artemis` : Creates a subgroup Artemis inside the group with index number 1.
* `clear` : Deletes all contacts.
* `exit` : Exits the application. <br>

Refer to the [Command Breakdown](#features) below for more details on each command.

## Command Breakdown
What follows is a detailed breakdown of all the commands Notor has available and what they do. All the commands have a shortened command format to make typing them easier.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `person /create (n:NAME)`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `/create n:John Doe`.
* Round brackets `()` refer to COMPULSORY arguments.<br>
  e.g. `(g:GROUP_NAME)` means that the group name must be entered at that position.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `(n:NAME) [g:GROUP_NAME]` can be used as `n:Elton g:Orbital` or as `n:Elton`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times, with a comma separating terms.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG…​]` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/tag1, tag2, tag3` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `g:GROUP_NAME sg:SUBGROUP_NAME`, `sg:SUBGROUP_NAME g:GROUP_NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p:12341234 p:56785678`, only `p:56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<a name = "person-command"></a>
### Working with people
The base functionality of Notor is allowing you to maintain notes on people who you mentor. These are the commands you can use with the `person` prefix to manage your contacts.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong>
  The following commands only work when persons are listed in Notor (visible in the List Pane).
</div>

#### _Creating a person_

Creates a person's contact card within Notor. When creating this person, you can pass optional arguments to fill out more information about them in a single command.

| Format                                                                        | Example                                                                    | What the example does                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `person (NAME) /create [p:PHONE] [e:EMAIL] [t:TAG1,TAG2,...] [g:GROUP_INDEX]` | `person John Lim /create p:91119111 e:notor@notor.com t:scholar g:1` | Creates the contact `John Lim`, with a phone number of `91119111`, and email of `notor@notor.com`. John is tagged with `scholar` and belongs to the group at index `1`              |
| `p (NAME) /c [p:PHONE] [e:EMAIL] [t:TAG1,TAG2,...] [g:GROUP_INDEX]`           | `p Dhruv Chopra /c p:92229222 e:dhruv.chopra@u.nus.sg t:AI, Crypto g:2`          | Creates the contact `Dhruv Chopra`, with a phone number of `92229222`, and email of `dhruv.chopra@u.nus.sg`. Dhruv is tagged with `AI` and `Crypto`, and belongs to the group at index `2` |


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Notes on parameters:</strong>
* Creates a person with the `NAME`. This name cannot start with a number.
* Optional arguments:
  * `PHONE`: Phone number of the person.
  * `EMAIL`: Email of the person.
  * `TAG1,TAG2..`: Tag(s) that describe the person.
  * `GROUP_INDEX`: Index of the group in Notor to add the person to.
* The person cannot have the same name as someone else in the group.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong>
Notor minimizes what you need to remember. To add the person to a group, you need to have groups displayed in the List Pane, so that you can select the group by its index instead of memorising and typing its name.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### _Adding a person to a group or subgroup_

Adds a person at the given index `INDEX` to a specified group. To add a person to a subgroup, include the subgroup parameter.

| Format                                                | Example                              | What the example does                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `person (INDEX) /add (g:GROUP_NAME)`                  | `person 1 /add g:Orbital`            | Adds the person at index `1` to the group `Orbital`                                                       |
| `p (INDEX) /a (g:GROUP_NAME)`                         | `p 2 /a g:Alumni`                    | Adds the person at index `2` to the group `Alumni`                                                        |
| `person (INDEX) /add (g:GROUP_NAME sg:SUBGROUP_NAME)` | `person 3 /add g:Orbital sg:Artemis` | Adds the person at index `3` to the subgroup `Artemis` which is contained within the group `Orbital`      |
| `p (INDEX) /a (g:GROUP_NAME sg:SUBGROUP_NAME)`        | `p 4 /a g:Alumni sg:Class 2010`      | Adds the person at index `4` to the subgroup  `Class 2010`  which is contained within the group  `Alumni` |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong>
Notor considers people within a subgroup as also being within the group that contains it. Hence, if you later try to [list all persons in group](#list-persons-in-group), anyone within a subgroup will also be listed.

| `p (INDEX) /d`          | `p 3 /d`           | Deletes the person at index `3` |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong>

### Archiving People
Archiving people allows you to only view the contacts you are actively managing, while still keeping the information
of older mentees within Notor. You might also want to view the [Export](#exporting-data) command. You can restore
archived mentees at any time.

#### _Archiving a person_

### Working with groups/subgroups
You can also create a group to organize people based on their common traits. In addition to groups, you can also create a subgroup
of a group to organize people based on a more specific category. 


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: <strong>Tip:</strong>
You can sort your contacts in Notor by the group that they are in, as well as taking general notes 
on the group. A few ideas on how you can use groups are:

<ul>
  <li>Group people you tend to talk to together. When meeting them, you can sort your Notor by that group, so that you can reference just their contacts.</li>
  <li>Group mentees with common interests. This makes it convenient if you want to reach out to all mentees with a certain shared interest.</li>
  <li>Group mentees who you need to achieve certain checkpoints with. For example, if in your job as a mentor
    you must find out from every mentee a certain list of goals, you can put this checklist into Notor as a group note, then reference it as you contact each mentee.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong>
All group commands except **Creating a group** will only work when groups or subgroups are listed.

## Filtering with Notor

Sometimes, you will want to view all people, groups, subgroups to understand what you have saved in your Notor. 
At other times, you will want to find those which fit into certain parameters. Here are the ways to view a subset of your data.

### List

List can show all persons, groups, subgroups which you have added to Notor.
It can also list archived persons: see [Archiving People](#archiving-people).

#### _Listing all persons_

Lists all persons in the List Pane.

| Format         | Short Format |
|----------------|--------------|
| `person /list` | `p /l`       |

#### _Listing all groups_

Lists all groups in the List Pane.

| Format         | Short Format |
|----------------|--------------|
| `group /list`  | `g /l`       |

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<a name = "list-persons-in-group"></a>
#### _Listing all persons in a group or subgroup_

Lists all persons in that group or subgroup.<br>

| Format               | Example        | What the example does                         |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `person (INDEX) /list` | `person 2 /list` | Lists all persons in group/subgroup at index `2` |
| `p (INDEX) /l`         | `p 3 /l`      | Lists all persons in group/subgroup at index `3` |


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong>
  * Only works if you have listed out all groups or subgroups in Notor.
  * Lists all persons of a group or subgroup that is at the given `INDEX`.
  * Do not confuse this with the list all subgroups command, whose first command word is `group`.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong>
Only works if you have listed out all groups or subgroups in Notor.
</div>

#### _Listing all subgroups in a group_

Lists all the subgroups within a group.

| Format              | Example       | What the example does                   |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `group (INDEX) /list` | `group 3 /list` | Lists all subgroups of group at index `3` |
| `g (INDEX) /l`        | `g 2 /l`        | Lists all subgroups of group at index `2` |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: <strong>Caution:</strong>
Do not confuse this with the list all persons in a group command, whose first command word is <code>person</code>.
</div> <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find

Find allows you to obtain the results that match with the keyword specified. You can filter in this way on people, groups, and subgroups. In addition, you may add additional parameters to your search, in order to narrow the search further.

#### _Finding persons_

Finds all persons that match your search term. You may search for partial matches within a persons name, or for tags the user must be tagged with. If you specify multiple search terms, only those people which match ALL criteria will be returned.

| Format                                        | Example                        | What the example does                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `person /find [n:NAME_QUERY] [t:TAG1, TAG2...]` | `person /find n:Elton t:CS2103T` | Finds all persons that that match `Elton` with tag that match `CS2103T` |
| `p /f [n:NAME_QUERY] [t:TAG1, TAG2...] `        | `p /f t:SWE`                     | Finds all persons with tag that match `SWE`                             |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong>
  * Finds all persons that match with given `NAME_QUERY`, or are tagged with the tags specified.
  * The query for the name will match if the string exists within the name, regardless of case: `jo` will match `John` and `joanne`.
  * Tags must be spelled exactly. You may specify more than one tag.
  * While the parameters have been marked optional, you must specify at least one of the parameters if you want to filter the results.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### _Finding groups or subgroups_

Finds all the groups/subgroups with the keyword specified. This will search for the keyword within the group's name.
Use after you have listed out all groups or subgroups.

| Format                   | Example               | What the example does                             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `group /find n:QUERY_NAME` | `group /find n:Artemis` | Finds all the groups/subgroups that match `Artemis` |
| `g /f n:QUERY_NAME`        | `g /f n:CS2103`         | Finds all the groups/subgroups that match `CS2103`  |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong>
  * Finds all the groups/subgroups that match the `KEYWORD`.
  * If the name contains the whole keyword within it, it will match: `art` will match `Art Jammers`, `Smart cookie`, and `Artemis`.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Miscellaneous information

### Saving the data

Notor data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous Notor home folder.

## What's next!

In the future, we would like to implement these features to enhance the experiences of mentors in using Notor:
  * View command for the viewing pane to support viewing other types of notes and command summary through the help command.
  * Different UI settings for the users to choose the color scheme they prefer.
  * Expand help window to improve user's experience in looking for help.
  * Import command to support importing data from CSV into Notor.
  * Tagging for groups.
  * And...more! Feel free to contact the team and share your suggestions at e0588244@u.nus.edu.

## Appendix: Tutorial

When you open Notor for the first time, you will see some dummy data for you to test out commands on. You can try out these commands sequentially to get familiar with Notor:

1. **`person /list`** : First, type this in to list all the people you have saved as contacts.

   <img src="images/Example1.png" alt="example1" width="75%" height="75%">

2. **`person 3 /delete`** : Use this command to delete the 3rd contact you have saved in Notor. This is the one listed at the 3rd index. In the example below `Charlotte Oliviero` will be removed.

   <img src="images/Example2.png" alt="example2" width="75%" height="75%">

   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

3. **`person User /create`** : To create a new contact person, type in this command. You can replace `User` with a name of your choice.

   <img src="images/Example3.png" alt="example3" width="75%" height="75%">

4. **`group CS2103T /create`** : To create a new group, type in this command. You can replace `CS2103T` with any group name you want.
    <img src="images/Example4.png" alt="example4" width="75%" height="75%">
    
    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
    
5. **`person 3 /add g:CS2103T`** : Now, if you want to add the person with index `3` to the group `CS2103T`. In the example shown below, the user named `David Li` will be added to the group `CS2103T`.<br>
    <img src="images/Example5.png" alt="example5" width="75%" height="75%">

6. **`group /list`** : To refer to the current group list, you can simply type in this command.
   <img src="images/Example6.png" alt="example6" width="75%" height="75%">
   
   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


7. **`group 1 /note`** : Edit the notes of the group with index number `1` with this command -- in the example below, `Orbital` is the group you will take notes on.

   <img src="images/Example7.png" alt="example7" width="75%" height="75%"> 
   
   <br> When the note window pops up, you can type whatever you like. Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + T` to drop the timestamp you opened the note. When you are done, press `Ctrl + Q` to exit the note window and save what you wrote.

8. **`group 1 /create n:Gemini`** : This command creates a new subgroup inside the group at index `1`. In the following example, a new subgroup called `Orbital_Gemini` is created from the parent group `Orbital`. The syntax `n:` is to indicate the **name** of the subgroup you have created.

     <img src="images/Example8.png" alt="example8" width="75%" height="75%">
    
     <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

9. Test out whatever commands you like. When you're done...


10. **`clear`** : Type this and hit enter to remove all the dummy data prepared for you.

     <img src="images/Example9.png" alt="example9" width="75%" height="75%"> <br>
