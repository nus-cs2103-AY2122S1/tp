<br><br>

CohortConnect is an advanced desktop address book which facilitates networking among Computer Science (CS) students. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

With advanced features for managing large groups of contacts, CohortConnect is intended for use in a university setting. At the start of the semester, professors will distribute `csv` or `json` files containing a list of students. Instantly load them into CohortConnect with a single **Import** command. With data collected from students before the semester, our **Find A Buddy** feature helps you find potential groupmates by leveraging GitHub’s metadata using a proprietary algorithm. In the **Events** tab, you can identify events and hackathons that your peers will be attending.

</p>


#### Working

The GitHub data used includes the percentage of contributions for different languages in the top 30 repositories, and the number of repos in the user's profile.

A similarity score is calculated using these features. The similarity score is based on the following three metrics:

- Euclidean Distance
- Manhattan Distance
- Cosine Similarity

On clicking a student, you can view the similarity score and the languages you have in common with the selected student.

### Show a Student Contact - `show`

Shows detailed information of a Student Contact. This can be done using the name 
of the contact, GitHub username, telegram id or the index. It shows the student with the corresponding detail containing the keyword.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: Note:
The show keywords are case-insensitive, john Doe will match with John Doe, JOHN DOE and JoHN DoE

</div>

Format 1: 

```
show <NAME>
```

Example 1:

```
show John Doe
```

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: Note:
If the exact name is not given, the show function will act similar to find and then you can pick out one contact from the given list.

</div>

Format 2:

```
show g/<GITHUB_USERNAME>
```

Example 2:

```
show g/john-doe
```

Format 3:

Importing will not remove existing contacts, and ignores duplicate contacts.

Format 1:

```
import <FILENAME>.json
```

import CS2103T.json
```

Format 2:

import <FILENAME>.csv
```

Example 2:

```
import CS2103T.csv
```

### Setting a Contact as Favorite - `fav`

Helps to set a particular Student Contact as a Favorite only if the contact has not been favorited.

Format:

```
fav <INDEX>
```

Example:

```
fav 1
```

### Setting a Contact as Unfavorite - `unfav`

Helps to set a particular Student Contact as an Unfavorite only if the contact has been favorited.

### Adding or removing tags from a contact - `tag`

Allows user to directly add or remove tag(s) from a specific student contact.

Format:

```
tag <INDEX> a/<TAG_TO_ADD> [MORE_TAGS] r/<TAG_TO_REMOVE> [MORE_TAGS]
```
>* Index is compulsory and must be a positive integer.<br>
>* To add or remove an event or module type tag, specify the tag type before the name of the tag. E.g. `tag 2 a/event-hackathon` (to add an event tag) or `tag 2 a/module-CS2103T` (to add a module tag) and likewise for remove. Tags specified without valid type before the name will be considered as general tags.<br>
* Users can choose to only add tag(s), only remove tag(s) or add tag(s) and remove tag(s)


* Adding tags : 
  * If `a/` is entered, it must be followed by the name(s) of tag(s) to be added. E.g. `tag 1 a/ r/friends` 
  would result in an error even if only the `friends` tag was to be removed.
  * Duplicate tags aren't allowed. E.g. `tag 1 a/teammate` would result in an error if the student contact at index 1 
  already has the tag `teammate`.
  * If multiple tags are to be added and there is at least 1 tag that is not already assigned to the specific contact, 
  then this tag is added and the remaining duplicate tags are ignored. E.g. if `tag 1 a/classmate a/cca` would result in only the `classmate` tag being added to the student contact at index 1 if it already has the tag `cca`.


* Removing tags :
  * If `r/` is entered, it must be followed by the name(s) of tag(s) to be removed. E.g. `tag 1 a/friends r/`
    would result in an error even if only the `friends` tag was to be added.
  * Attempting to remove a tag that is not assigned to the specified contact is not allowed. E.g. `tag 1 r/teammate` would result in an error if the student contact at index 1
    is not assigned the tag `teammate`.
  * If multiple tags are to be removed and there is at least 1 valid tag that can be removed from the specific contact,
    then this tag is removed and the remaining invalid tags are ignored. E.g. if `tag 1 r/classmate r/cca` would result in only the `classmate` tag being removed from the student contact at index 1 if the tag `cca` is not assigned to them already.

Examples:
* Adding single (general) tag : `tag 1 a/friends`
* Adding single (event) tag : `tag 2 a/event-hackathon`
* Adding multiple tags : `tag 3 a/friends a/teammate`
* Removing multiple (general) tags : `tag 2 r/family owesmoney`
* Removing multiple (module) tags : `tag 2 r/module-CS1101S module-MA1521`
* Adding and removing a tag : `tag 4 a/friends r/colleagues`
