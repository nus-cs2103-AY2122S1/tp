### Notes about command format:

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [h/HEALTH_CONDITION]` can be used as `n/John Doe h/dementia` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[h/HEALTH_CONDITION]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `h/dementia`, `h/dementia h/diabetes` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:exclamation: Extra input in a command? Take note!**<br>

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

- If a parameter is expected but two consecutive flags are given (i.e. no spaces between two flags), only the first parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `sort v/lv/`, only `v/` will be taken.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- Commands only check values associated to valid flags but not additional input other than valid flags.
</div>
