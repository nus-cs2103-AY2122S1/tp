Around the World in $80 (AWE) is a desktop application for keeping track of spending and expenditure during travels, splitting 
expenses with travel-mates, and facilitating easy recollection of debts at the end of every trip. AWE is the world's
only bespoke app designed for group travellers.

The app promises to revolutionize the group-travel space. With AWE, bills can be split and monitored in a centralized
manner that minimizes the potential for disputes and maximizes the efficiency of payment and recollection of debts.

AWE's vision is a more interconnected world where relationships are more easily built and maintained.
Our mission is to accomplish through a user-centric approach that seeks to provide the user with what they need, at the
tip of their fingertips. This document marks the first step towards the accomplishment of that mission, and the
beginning of your journey around the world.

## **1. About the Document**

The purpose of this document is to make sure that you have a pleasant and intuitive experience when using our app.
In line with our user-centric approach, the guide is structured to ensure that the knowledge of the workings of our app
is easily accessible.
The document serves as a guide for users to understand the way to use our app to extract maximum satisfaction.

**To accomplish this, we have taken the following steps**
* We provide you with a glossary of contents to explain away some vocabulary that you might find confusing, so that you 
can focus on exploring AWE to the full extent of its functionalities.
* We provide you with the tools to be able to read this guide with little need for re-referencing previous sections.

[Section 1](#1-about-the-document) provides readers with a brief overview of how to use this document. [Section 2](#2-quick-start) details the setting up of AWE
and [Section 3](#3-features) documents the main features of AWE. If you still face problems using AWE, refer to our FAQ in [Section 4](#4-faq).

### 1.1 Glossary

Term | Explanation
--------|------------------
**Command Line Interface (CLI)** | The Command Line Interface, or CLI for short, is the user interface on which AWE is based. This means that most of AWE's functionality is unlocked by the typing of inputs by the user, rather than the clicking of a mouse or the selection of options via a menu.
**Graphical User Interface (GUI)** | The Graphical User Interface, or GUI for short, is a user interface which supports all of its features through the clicking of a mouse or the selection of options via a menu. It does not require users to type in commands.
**Command** | Commands are the user inputs that trigger the specific features of the app. Commands are often denoted in highlighted letters. For instance, to create a group, the `creategroup` command is utilized. 
**Parameter** | A Parameter refers to a specific detail required for a command. For instance, adding a contact within an app would require details such as the contact's name. In this case, the name is a parameter of this command. Parameters are often denoted in the guide in highlighted uppercase letters, for eg. `NAME`.

### 1.2 Format of commands
If you wish to jump straight into using our features, refer to Section 5 for the summary of commands.
Here are some key pointers to take note of.
1. Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by you.
2. Words that are enclosed in `[   ]` denote optional parameters that the user can choose to enter or leave out.
3. You will notice that our commands require you to use characters such as `n/`, `t/`, etc. This allows our programme
to locate which words belong to which category of input.

## **2. Quick start**
AWE's primary asset is its speed. Unlike traditional Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) which rely on slow actions such as mouse clicking and selection of options from long menus, with its CLI, AWE offers users the benefit of speed.
For those who type fast, the app will be faster than most mainstream contact management apps.
For those who are not as fast, familiarity with the commands over time will allow you to harness the full capabilities of AWE.

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. Follow [this guide](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/download-and-install-java-11-openjdk-and-oracle-jdk) to install it.

2. Download the latest `awe.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your tp.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   * **`creategroup`** : The command `creategroup gn/Bali n/John Doe n/Alex Yeoh t/friends` creates a group named Bali containing members `John Doe` and `Alex Yeoh`, with the tag `friends`.

   * **`deletegroup`** : The command `deletegroup gn/Bali` removes the group named Bali.
   
   * **`addexpense`** : The command `addexpense n/Alex Yeoh gn/Bali $/50 d/drinks` adds an expense paid for by `Alex Yeoh` into the group `Bali` of `$50` for `drinks`.

   * **`deleteexpense`** : The command `deleteexpense 1` removes the 1st expense (by one-based-index) from the list of expenses visible to the user.
   
   * **`transactionsummary `** : The command `transactionsummary  gn/Bali` provides a list of spending made by each user in the group named Bali.

   * **`calculatepayments`** : The command `calculatepayments gn/Bali` provides a list of payments to be made between users to settle debts for the group named Bali.

## **3. Features**

**Breakdown of command abbreviations:** <br>

* `d/`: Description (1 to 50 characters in length)
* `gn/`: Group Name (1 to 50 characters in length)
* `n/`: Name (1 to 50 characters in length)
* `p/`: Phone number (3 to 16 digits in length)
* `t/`: Tag (1 to 50 characters in length)
* `$/`: Cost 

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order other than [`addexpense`](#332-adding-a-shared-expense-addexpense) and [`groupeditname`](#329-editing-travel-group-name-groupeditname). <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clearalldata`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
* Except `findexpenses`, `findgroups`, `findcontacts`, parameters for other commands are case-sensitive.

* Do note that the [Contact-related commands](#51-contacts-commands) and
[Expense-related commands](#53-expense-commands) both accept an index as an argument to identify which
contact/expense to delete. On the other hand, [Group-related commands](#52-groups-commands) accept a unique group
name as an argument. For the reasons behind this implementation, refer to our [FAQ](#4-faq)

* Do not add any additional special characters when entering a command. For example, if you enter
`deletegroup gn/Bali p/12345678` for a `deletegroup` command that is only meant to contain the special character `gn/`, 
AWE will take `Bali p/12345678` as the group name and raise an error informing the user of an invalid group name.

Uses the net spend of the user on the trip to tabulate a fast set of payments to settle the debts between members of the group.

Format: `calculatepayments gn/GROUP_NAME`

* GROUP_NAME is a mandatory field.
* A group with GROUP_NAME as its name must exist.
* Output e.g. [`John pays Mark $20.50`, `Sara pays Dev $15`]
* When you use this command, you will be brought to the payments page for the specified group if you are currently viewing a different page.

Examples:
* `calculatepayments gn/Bali`
* `calculatepayments gn/London`<br>

**Note:** When a `contact` is deleted or removed from the group, the functioning of this command does not change. The deleted contact may still be part of the list of payments depending on the expenses they had previously.

#### 3.4.5. Editing the data file

AWE data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/awe.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

* If the contact details in the JSON file is changed without making the same changes to expenses, AWE will treat the old and new contacts as separate contacts.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AWE will discard all data and start with sample data at the next run.

## **4. FAQ**
**Q**: Why is NAME case-sensitive?<br>
**A**: Since identical names are very common in many cultures, we have decided to allow the addition of 2 contacts such as "jun jie" and "Jun Jie" in order to keep track of their numbers. 
Furthermore, since AWE deals with overseas travels, quite a number of travellers might get a new overseas number when they are travelling. This will allow users to keep track of both
their local and overseas local separately. Deleting the number after returning from the trip will be easier as well. In both cases, users can distinguish the 2 contacts with similar names using tags.
This is also consistent with most mobile-phones, wherein contact names are case-sensitive.
To address the overseas number use case, for our next release, we are considering providing users with the ability to input more than one phone number when adding a contact.

**Q**: Why is GROUP_NAME case-sensitive?<br>
**A**: Similar to the above question, a user might travel to the same destination more than once. 
This will allow the addition of each individual trips.
To address this use case, we are considering requiring a DATE_TIME parameter when creating a group. 
We did not do so for this release due to concerns that two separate groups of users might be on a trip at the same location in the same time frame.
In this case, users might be unable to create two groups, even though the use case would merit such an action.

**Q**: Why are some commands accept an index as an argument whereas other commands accept names as an argument?<br>
**A**: [Contact-related commands](#51-contacts-commands) and [Expense-related commands](#53-expense-commands) both use 
an index to identify which contact/expense to modify. Users can simply view the list of contacts/expenses and choose
the relevant index in a convenient manner as compared to typing out the full name. However, groups contain a large
amount of sensitive information (such as membership and expenses) that cannot be recovered upon deletion. As such, our
team decided to implement [Group-related commands](#52-groups-commands) by accepting the unique group name as an
argument. This minimizes the chances of accidentally deleting a group.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install AWE on the other computer and replace the empty data file it creates with the data file used by the AWE on your previous computer.

**Q**: What if the Jar file does not open properly when I double click on it?<br>
**A**: Open a command prompt in that folder and run the command `java -jar awe.jar`.

**Q**: What do I do if I see `awe.jar` cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer when I double click the jar file on a mac?<br>
**A**: Go to `System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> General` and click on `Open anyways` as such
