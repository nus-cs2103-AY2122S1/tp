<h2 align ="center"> WhereTourGo: A Tour Guide’s Best Friend! </h2>

**WhereTourGo (WTG)** is a desktop app for managing your tour contacts, optimized for use via a Command-Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The app helps you easily collate and access contacts of a variety of several services such as F&B, accommodations, attractions etc. It is also enhanced with many functionalities to make modification and navigation a smooth experience.

A CLI processes your commands in the form of lines of text, while a GUI is another form of user interface that allows you to interact with our app through graphical icons.

Once you are familiar with our commands, typing fast in CLI allows you to get your contact management tasks done faster and more efficiently than traditional GUI apps. Handling repetitive tasks also becomes easier as we offer access to input history, allowing you to access past commands conveniently.

This User Guide will help you set up your contact list and familiarise yourself with the features of WhereTourGo.

### Reading this document
This section introduces some technical terms, symbols and syntax used in this guide. Do try to familiarize yourself with them before moving on to the subsequent sections.


#### Technical Terms
The table below explains some technical terms frequently used throughout this User Guide.

| Term |  What it means |
|:----------:|-------------|
| CLI |  The Command-Line Interface (or CLI for short) is the user interface in which WhereTourGo is based. Typically, users interact with the app by providing text input. Unlike traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) base apps, it may be less intuitive to new users. However upon familiarisation, fast typists may find it faster to use. |
| Command word| The Command word refers to the keywords which WhereTourGo recognises to invoke specific commands. These command words will be indicated by `COMMAND WORD` in the various sections below. |
|Parameter|Parameter refers to the user input required after the user is prompted by WhereTourGo. |


#### General Symbols and Syntax
The table below explains the general notations used throughout the user guide.

| Syntax |  What it means |
|:----------:|-------------|
| `command` |  A grey highlighted block specifies an executable command, or parameters that can be entered into the command box.  |
| _italics_ | Italicised text indicates that the text has a definition specific to WhereTourGo, or it is a caption for a Figure in the guide. |
|<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: </div>  | A light bulb indicates that the following text is a useful tip. |
|<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger"> :warning: </div> | A warning sign indicates that the following text is important. |


#### Format of Commands
The following points explain the format of a command.
More examples will be provided for each command in [Features](#features).

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Mandarin Oriental`.

* Items in **square brackets** are **optional**<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Mandarin Oriental t/hotel` or as `n/Mandarin Oriental`.

* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including none<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times) `t/food`, `t/wine t/food`  or not at all

* Parameters can be in any order<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specify it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Duplicate contact names are not allowed
  e.g. if there exists a contact named ‘Marina Bay Sands’, adding or editing a contact with the name ‘Marina Bay Sands’ is not allowed.<br>

# FAQ
**Q**: How do I save my data?<br>
**A**: Your contact list is saved in your hard disk automatically for each command that modifies the list.

**Q**: Where is my data saved?<br>
**A**: When our app is first opened, it will create a folder named data in the same folder where the JAR file is located.
This folder contains a file called `addressbook.json` which contains all of your contacts with the corresponding details.

**Q**: Where can I find my text file after executing the `export` command?
**A**: You can find the nicely-formatted text file called `export.txt` in the folder named data. (Path: `data/export.txt`)

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer. Overwrite the empty data file it creates with the data file from your previous WhereTourGo home folder.

**Q**: What do I do if I forget the format of all the commands?<br>
**A**: You can type either `cmd` to show the command summary or `help` to open our User Guide.

**Q**: Why does cmd/help command open a backup window with a link instead of my browser?<br>
**A**: Check to ensure that your browser installed has been upgraded to the latest version. Restart the app and try again. If the issue still isn't resolved, please contact us at "WhereTourGo@gmail.com".
