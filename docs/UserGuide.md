   [Windows](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/download-and-install-java-11-openjdk-and-oracle-jdk) \
   [macOS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-macos.html#GUID-F575EB4A-70D3-4AB4-A20E-DBE95171AB5F)

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for plannerMD.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the image displayed below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

## What is Command-line Interface (CLI?) <a name="what-is-cli"></a>
A Command-line interface helps process commands that you enter through text. Instead of clicking buttons, to execute a certain command,
you would type the command in text in the command box, and the programme will execute your command, and reflect its response in the response box.

![get format](images/user-guide/commandBox.png)

### Why CLI?
We want to give you an experience that is as similar as writing with pen-and-paper, to help you clinic receptionists adapt easily. With a CLI,
you can imagine the keyboard as your pen, and a command box as your paper. To clinic receptionists who are already using a different application
with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), our application removes the need to constantly access your mouse and speed up your arduous process of managing
patients, doctors and appointments.

### How to use a CLI?
Just type your command in the command box with the format we have provided. Simple as that!
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can type the command keyword and leave the details blank and click enter to access the template so you don't have to remember
all the details!<br>

## Features <a name="features"/>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format**<br>
* `Format:` shows the format to type the respective commands

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME hp/PHONE_NUMBER`, `hp/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `hp/12341234 hp/56785678`, only `hp/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `IWANTTOCLEAREVERYTHING`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
