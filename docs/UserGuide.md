As a student entrepreneur with a busy schedule, do you always find yourself missing an appointment/meeting with
your clients or friends? Or can't seem to find a way to easily recall details of a certain someone
who is probably stored as one of your many contacts in your Excel sheet? Fret not,
as we have designed an application called **ContactSH** just for you! It is a Desktop application for managing your contacts
as well as tasks related to each of them. It boasts a highly effective search function and contact-task tracking system.
It is also optimized for use via a Command Line Interface(CLI) that is similar in style as Linux CLIs,
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, you will be able to manage
business tasks related to your contacts more efficiently than using other traditional GUI apps.

The [Quick Start](#quick-start) section shows you how to quickly get ContactSH up and running on your computer.
If you are a new user, it is recommended to go through the instructions under [Features](#features) one by one.
If you are an experienced user, and just want to refer to the list of features, you may use the [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
to quickly navigate to the command of your choice.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add -nNAME`, `NAME` is a parameter to be specified: `add -nJohn Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional parameters.<br>
  e.g `-nNAME [-lLABEL]` can be specified as `-nJohn Doe -lfriend` or `-nJohn Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be specified multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[-lLABEL]…​` can be specified as `` (i.e. 0 times), `-lfriend`, `-lfriend -lfamily` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command format is `-nNAME -pPHONE_NUMBER`, `-pPHONE_NUMBER -nNAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command format, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be accepted.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `-p12341234 -p56785678`, only `-p56785678` will be accepted.<br> There are a few exceptions to this which are the find command and the cat command. In such cases, if a parameter is expected only once and there are more than one standalone flag, the words after the first flag will be taken as keywords.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `ls`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `ls 123`, the command will be interpreted as `ls`.

* Cache will be emptied once you end the session (the application is closed). Hence, `commands` from previous sessions cannot be retrieved.

### Saving the data

* ContactSH data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

* ContactSH data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/contactsh.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ContactSH will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
