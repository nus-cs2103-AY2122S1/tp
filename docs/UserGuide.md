## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 What is TutAssistor?
Welcome to the user guide of TutAssistor!

Are you a private tutor struggling to keep track of all your classes and students? Do you spend 
countless hours on administrative duties such as scheduling classes and updating numerous students' records?

If the above situation sounds familiar to you, fret not, **TutAssistor** is here to save the day!

**TutAssistor** is a ***desktop app intended for private tutors like yourself to 
manage their students and classes, and it is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)***.

**TutAssistor** uses Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you operate the application by typing commands into a Command Box. 
If you are a fast typer, you can operate the application more easily and faster than
Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact 
with the application via graphical icons such as buttons.

You do not have to worry at all even if you are new to CLI applications as 
this user guide will take you through step by step on how various 
features of the **TutAssistor** can be utilised, all directed towards 
providing the best possible experience to the user.

### 1.2 What can TutAssistor do for you?

TutAssistor provides an all-in-one platform for you to manage information 
regarding your students and lessons stress-free and efficiently. In the latest version, we offer you the ability to: 

* Track student details
* Keep student details up-to-date
* Resolve conflicting tuition timeslots
* Efficiently create notes for each class/student
* View scheduled lessons in a timetable

### 1.3 How to use this guide?

* **Command Format** - Each command is accompanied by a set of information that you provide. Refer to the [Features](#3-features) below for details of each command.
* **Examples** - Possible usage of each features are provided. You may follow these examples when familiarising with the app. 
* **Screenshots** - A visualisation of the expected outcome is provided for some features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3 Features
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/student` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.<br>
  e.g. `si/STUDENT_INDEX [STUDENT_INDEX]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `si/1`, `si/1 2 3` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
   
Refer to the [Additional Command Format Information](#4-additional-command-format-information) under section 4 to learn the requirements of the various parameters used.

  * After the user executes the `sort` command, the list will continue to remain sorted even after adding or editing classes.
  
  * The list will not be automatically sorted upon restarting TutAssistor, i.e., the user will have to execute the `sort` command again.

  * For alphabetical order, the sorting is case-insensitive. For example, `chem` is considered the same as `Chem`.

  * For time order, the sorting assumes Gregorian calendar format. i.e. Sunday is considered the start of a week and 
    Saturday is considered the end of a week.


</div>

The possible usages of `sort` are given below:
* `sort` sorts by time
* `sort o/asc` sorts by ascending alphabetical order

  If a lesson is shorter than one hour, the timetable may not display its details properly, such as using smaller font size or omitting the details completely due to limited space in the time block.
  
  For example, in Figure 7 below, the class on Monday, 15:00-15:15 is only 15 minutes and thus not displayed with details.
</div>

## 4 Additional Command Format Information

The requirements of the various parameters used are explained below. Head back to [Features](#3-features) to refer to general notes on the command format.

### 4.1 Name

Student name is unique, i.e., there cannot be 2 or more students registered with the same name. TutAssistor ignores
letter case and trivial whitespaces when it checks for duplicate names.

Note that if you successfully add a student, the name will appear exactly as what you typed, including trivial whitespaces.

For example, when adding a new student, given an existing student named `John Doe`, 

- Valid: `John Doe the Great` 
- Invalid: `john doe`, <code>John &ensp; Doe</code>

Names for tuition classes may be reused.

For example, given an existing class named `Biology`, you may add a new class also named `Biology`.

### 4.2 Phone Number
Phone number should only contain digits, and should be at least 3 digits long.

### 4.3 Email
Email should be of the format `local-part@domain` and adhere to the following constraints:
1. The `local-part` should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, `+` `_` `.` `-`. The `local-part` may not start or end with any special characters.
2. This is followed by a `@` and then a `domain` name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
   The domain name must:
    - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
    - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
    - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any

### 4.4 Timeslot
Timeslot for classes follows the format:
```
Ddd HH:mm-HH:mm
```
where
- `Ddd` is the day of the week, **abbreviated to the first three letters, with only the first letter capitalised**.

    Examples:
    - Correct: `Mon`, `Tue`, `Wed`, `Thu`, `Fri`, `Sat`, `Sun`
    - Incorrect: `mon`, `tuesday`, `WED`, `Thurs`, `Friday`, etc
- `HH:mm` is the time with 2 digits for the hour and 2 digits for the minute. The first time must be earlier in the day than the second time.

    Examples:
    - Correct: `09:00-14:30`
    - Incorrect: `9:00-14:00`, `9am-2pm`, `9-2`, `09:00-08:00`

### 4.5 Index
Index for a student or tuition class must be a positive integer, starting from `1`. It must not exceed the size of the list.

For example, if the list consists of `5` students/tuition classes:
- Correct: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`
- Incorrect: `0`, `1.5`, `a`, `6`, etc.

## 5 FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TutAssistor home folder.<br>

**Q**: Do I lose all the details of classes and students when I close the application?<br>
**A**: All of your data is stored locally in a file under the data folder and will be loaded upon the next entry,
hence you do not lose any data.<br>

**Q**: What should I do if I am unsure of the command formats?<br>
**A**: Please type `help` to learn the command formats.<br>
