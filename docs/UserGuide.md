* A friend with the given `FRIEND_ID` provided must exist in the friends list.
* The friend has to be previously linked to the game with the given `GAME_ID`.

#### 5.1.7 Scheduling a friend's availability: `friend --schedule`

Schedules an existing friend by updating their schedule to indicate the time periods they are free or busy.
* gitGud stores a weekly schedule for each friend, from Monday to Sunday, with each day having 24 blocks of hours that can be marked as free or busy.
* The hourly blocks of time allows users to get an estimate of when their friends are free, allowing them to easily find common timeslots to play.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

* gitGud displays the periods of time friends are free using the 24-hour notation.
The end of a day, midnight (12am) is displayed as `2400` to allow users to easily differentiate it 
from the start of the day, which is displayed as `0000`.

</div>  

Command constraints:

* `START_HOUR` and `END_HOUR` must be an integer between 0 and 24 inclusive, and represents the hour of the day.
  * `END_HOUR` must be strictly after `START_HOUR`.
  * For example, `START_HOUR` = 2 and `END_HOUR` = 20 represents the time period from the 2nd to the 20th hour of the day.

## **6. Managing data**
Your friends and games application data is stored in the files within the `data` folder relative to the where the `gitGud.jar` file
is running on your computer `[JAR file location]/data/gamesList.json` and `[JAR file location]/data/friendsList.json`.

### 6.1 Saving of application data 
Application data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. 
There is no need to save manually.

### 6.2 Editing data files externally
For advanced users, you are able to change the values stored in the data files directly. 
However, this is **not recommended** and may cause your files to be corrupted - hence, we will not be covering the in-depth
details in our guide. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: Warning:** If the changes you have made cause the format of the data files to be invalid, 
gitGud will start with **empty data for the list(s) affected by the invalid file(s)** at the next run and 
may override the invalid files with subsequent saves.
This may cause **loss of data** and hence should be avoided unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing!
</div>
