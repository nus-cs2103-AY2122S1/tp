## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [m/MEDICAL_HISTORY]` can be used as `n/John Doe m/cancer` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`  after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[m/MEDICAL_HISTORY]… ` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `m/Diabetes`, `m/Scoliosis m/High Blood Pressure` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* `INDEX` must a positive integer of the given item in the panel.

* `DATETIME` must be in the format `yyyy-mm-dd HHmm` for all commands, with time using 24-Hour notation.<br>
