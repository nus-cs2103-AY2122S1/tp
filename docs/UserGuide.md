Welcome to the SportsPA User Guide!
</span>

SportsPA is a desktop application targeted for use among NUS sports CCA Leaders. It manages membership and
training sessions for NUS sports CCAs. SportsPA allows you to keep track of details of your members as well as
facilities to hold training sessions at. With SportsPA, you will be able to quickly organise training sessions as we
help you allocate available members into the various facilities according to their specified capacity.

SportsPA mainly uses a CLI (Command Line Interface), meaning that you simply have to type in commands to use it. This user
guide provides an in-depth documentation on all the commands available. If this is your first time using SportsPA,
we also provide a [quick start guide](#quick-start) that demonstrates the end-to-end setup process to get you started.

## Using SportsPA's Interface

While SportsPA has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to display data and messages, you interact with it mainly
by typing. The figure below provides an overview of the key components in our interface. <br><br>
![Gui](images/Gui.png)

Typically, to execute a command, this is how you interact with the interface:

1. Type the desired command into the **Command Window** and press **Enter** on your keyboard.
2. The results of the command (or any warning messages generated) are displayed in the **Result Window**.
3. Any changes made to the data will be reflected accordingly in the **List Window**.

SportsPA stores two lists - **Members** and **Facilities**, which you can freely switch between by clicking on the respective **Tabs**. Alternatively, whenever you execute a member-specific or facility-specific command, SportsPA automatically switches to the relevant tab for you.

Here are some example commands you can try:

* **`help`** : Displays help window.

* **`listm`** : Lists all members.

* **`listf`** : Lists all facilities.

* **`addf n/Court 1 l/University Sports Centre t/1700 c/10`** : Adds the facility named `Court 1` to the facilities
  list.

* **`deletem 3`** : Deletes 3rd member in the members list.

* **`exit`** : Exits the app.

## Features

This section documents all the commands available in SportsPA, guiding you through its function, format, example usages
and any other noteworthy tips. **Note that examples ending with :camera: means that a screenshot of the outcome is provided below.**

For a summary of all the commands, refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary). If this
is your first read, do go through the following notes about the command format to help you better understand the
documentation.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Characters with the slash symbols are used to indicate the type of parameter supplied by the user.
  <br> e.g. in `addm n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `n/` and `p/` are the symbols used before entering a parameter for `NAME`
  and `PHONE_NUMBER` respectively.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `deletem INDEX`, `INDEX` is a parameter which can be used as `deletem 1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [d/DAY(S)] [t/TAG]...` can be used as `n/Ben p/91111111 d/1` or as `n/John p/91111111` or
  as `n/John p/91111111 t/exco`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times, by repeating the character with slash symbol,
  if present, and the parameter.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as ` `(i.e. 0 times), `t/exco`, `t/exco t/y2`etc.

* Parameters with `(S)` at the end, can be supplied one or more times without repeating the characters with slash
  symbols.<br>
  e.g. `d/DAY(S)` can be used as `d/1`, `d/1 2`, etc.

* Parameters with the slash symbols can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME l/LOCATION`, `l/LOCATION n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter wll be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `listf`, `clearm` and `exit`) will
  be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Member-Specific Features

#### Adding a member: `addm`

Adds a member to your members list.

Format: `addm n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [d/DAY(S)] [t/TAG]...`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** For the parameter `d/DAY(S)`, if the member is not available on any one of the specified days,
they will not be shown in the filtered list (i.e members have to be available on all specified days in order for them to be 
shown in the list).
</div>

Examples:

* `findm n/John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `findm t/exco t/y2` returns members with either tags `exco` `y2`, or both :camera:

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Setting member availability: `setm`

The availability of your members can change frequently. Thus, instead of having to individually edit your members' availability, use
`setm` to set the availability of given member(s) at one go.

Format: `setm INDEX [MORE_INDICES]... d/DAY(S)`

* Sets the availability of the member(s) at the specified `INDEX` and `MORE_INDICES` to be the specified `DAY(S)`

* `MORE_INDICES` **must be separated by a single space** e.g. `1 2 3`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Setting the availability of a member will automatically remove them from any facilities they were allocated to. 
This action is **irreversible**.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** All indices provided must be in the range of the displayed member list. Otherwise,
the command will be considered invalid and none of the member's availability will be set.

directly change the contents, *e.g a member's name*, in the data file, which will be reflected in SportsPA.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If changes made to the data file makes its format invalid, SportsPA will start with an empty data file at the next run.
