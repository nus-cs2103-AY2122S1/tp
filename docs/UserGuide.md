CohortConnect is an advanced desktop address book which facilitates networking among Computer Science (CS) students. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

With advanced features for managing large groups of contacts, CohortConnect is intended for use in a university setting. At the start of the semester, professors will distribute `csv` or `json` files containing a list of students. Instantly load them into CohortConnect with a single **Import** command. With data collected from students before the semester, our **Find A Buddy** feature helps you find potential groupmates by leveraging GitHub’s metadata using a proprietary algorithm. In the **Events** tab, you can identify events and hackathons that your peers will be attending.
