## Quick Start

Now that you have installed Tutor Master, let us give it a try!

Let us 
1. Create a student named "David" 
2. Add and assign a task named "Science Report" to "David".
3. Add him to a group named "CS2103T"

We shall type commands in the Command Panel and hit `Enter` to execute it.

Here are some starting commands to help you navigate around the application:

### Managing Students

Since the goal is to manage students, let's start by adding a new student to the address book.
Let's try adding a student with the following details:
* Name: David
* Phone Number: 90001111
* Email: david@gmail.com
* Address: Singapore

1. Type the command `student -a n/David p/90001111 e/david@gmail.com a/Singapore` and hit `Enter`.
   * This adds a student with the details specified.
   * You will now be able to see __David__ at the entry in the Person Panel on the left,
   as shown in the image below.
   ![Add David](images/imagesInUG/student-addDavid.png)
   
2. Now lets try editing his address. Note the index number beside his name in the Person Panel, in this case it is 4.<br>
   Type the following command `student -e 4 a/Kent Ridge` and hit `Enter`.
   * This updates the address of David, who is at index __4__ to __Kent Ridge__.
   * Note that the other details are unchanged, you can choose which fields you want to edit.
<br><br>

3. You can add a lesson to David. Let's assign a __Math__ lesson from __10:00__ to __12:00__ on __Friday__. <br>
   Type the following command `student -al 4 s/Math st/10:00 et/12:00 d/Fri` and hit `Enter`.
   * This adds a lesson to David with the given details.
   * You can view your schedule for the week by entering `schedule`, try it!
<br><br>

4. If you wish to view more details of a student, you can use the student view command.<br>
   Type `student -v 4` in the Command Panel and hit `Enter`.
    * This displays the student at `STUDENT_INDEX` 4 in the Viewing Panel.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Managing Tasks

Next, let us add a task with description __Lab Report__ and deadline __12 November 2021__. 

1. Type the command `task -a n/Lab Report d/2021-11-12` in the Command Panel and hit `Enter`.
    * This adds a task with the details specified above. 
    * You should now see __Lab Report__ in the Task Panel in the middle column as shown in the image below.
      ![Add David](images/imagesInUG/task-add.png)

2. Now, let us try editing the description of the task to Science Report. Note the index of the task in the Task Panel, 
   which is 3 in this case. Type `task -e 3 n/Science Report` in the Command Panel and hit `Enter`.
    * This updates the description of the task at index __3__ to __Science Report__.
    * The description remains unchanged.

    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

3. You can also assign this task, __Science Report__ to __David__.
    * Take note of the index of the task you would like to
      assign and the index of the student to whom the task should be assigned. In this case, the index of
      __Science Report__ is __3__ while the index of __David__ is __4__.
    * Type the command `task -as 4 3` in the Command Panel and hit `Enter`.
    * This assigns __Science Report__ to __David__.

### Managing Groups

Let us now add "David" to a group named "CS2103T".

1.  Type `group -a 4 n/CS2103T` in the Command Panel and hit `Enter`.
    * This creates a group named __CS2103T__ and includes __David__ who is at `STUDENT_INDEX` 4 in the Person Panel.
    * __CS2103T__ is now added to the Group Panel. It has an `GROUP_INDEX` of 3 in the Group Panel.
    * This group currently has __David__ inside
      ![Add David To Group](images/imagesInUG/group-addDavidInGroup.png)

2. Type `group -v 3` in the Command Panel and hit `Enter`.
    * This displays the details of the group at `GROUP_INDEX` 3 in the Viewing Panel.

You can refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  * e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets `[]` are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* `INDEX` parameters are very common in this application. Ensure that **they are a positive integer and is less than 2,147,483,648**.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? <br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Tutor Master home folder.

**Q**: How do I edit lesson details of a student? <br>
**A**: There is currently no functionality for that, the workaround will be to [delete the lesson](#deleting-a-lesson-from-a-student-student--dl)
first before [adding it again](#adding-a-lesson-to-a-student-student--al) with the new details.
