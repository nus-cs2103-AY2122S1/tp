3. Copy the JAR file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for **GameBook**. Your gambling records will later be saved in your home folder.

4. Double-click the JAR file to start the app. A window similar to below should appear in a few seconds.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format and input:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>

  e.g. In `add /g GAME_TYPE /s INITIAL_CASH /e FINAL_CASH`, GAME_TYPE, INTIIAL_CASH, and FINAL_CASH are
  parameters the user needs to supply. An example is `add /g poker /s 0.01 /e 1.02`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>

  e.g. In `add /g GAME_TYPE /p PROFIT [/date DATE] [/dur DURATION] [/loc LOCATION] [/tag TAGS]`, DATE, DURATION,
  LOCATION and TAGS are optional fields. `add /g poker /p 10.40` and `add /g poker /p 10.40 /date 2021-09-11 21:20 /dur 40` are both deemed
  as correct usages.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`

* Empty parameters are not allowed and will result in an error message.<br>
e.g. `... /date /tag` will result in an error message.
</div>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the displayed list:**<br>

* Displayed list of game entries is implicitly sorted by date.
  * Game entries with later dates are displayed above game entries with earlier dates.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer (refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start)) and replace the empty gamebook.json file it creates within the data folder with your `gamebook.json` file from your original computer.

**Q**: Can I edit the data by directly modifying the data file?<br>
**A**: Technically, you can if you follow the exact storage format. However, we strongly advise against it as any
mistakes will cause errors in the app.

**Q**: (Follow up from previous question) What is the storage format of the data file?<br>
**A**: Data is stored in JSON format, with each entry being stored as a JSON object with the keys being `gameEntries`, `startAmount`, `endAmount`, `date`, `durationMinutes`, `location` and `tagged`.
The exact format can be explored by checking out the format of the sample data that GameBook is initialized with. The data file is stored at `/data/gamebook.json`, and the
`data` directory is located in the same directory where you placed the JAR file at.
