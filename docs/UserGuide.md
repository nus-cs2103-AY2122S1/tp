## Introduction to Socius

Socius is a desktop application that can help you, as a CS2103T Software Engineering student, to
* manage your classmates’ contacts
* make friends and
* find teammates!

The Socius User Guide helps you get started with using Socius.
This User Guide hopes to get you familarized with the commands of Socius and the flow of using the program, helping you to achieve maximum efficiency so that you can get the most out of it.
If you already have experience with using Socius, a summary table is available at the end for quick reference!

We hope that you will have a great time using Socius! :)

Here are some main features Socius provides:
* Access details of coursemates taking CS2103T.
* Find any coursemate(s) with their name, tutorial group, nationalities, tags and more.
* Tag coursemates with suitable tags to categorize them.
* View statistics on nationality.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
Socius is optimized for use via a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. If you can
type fast, Socius can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional *GUI* apps.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using this guide

Before diving into Socius and getting to know its features, lets get familiar with the symbols used in this user guide.

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :----: | ------- |
| :information_source: | Important information |
| :exclamation: | Warnings or cautions |
| :bulb: | Additional information such as tips |
| :wrench: | Help with common technical issues |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

Here is a quick start on how you can start using our app in your own computer.

1. Ensure you have [*Java 11*](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `Socius.jar` on our [Releases](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/releases) page.

3. Move the file `Socius.jar` to a folder you want to use as the home folder for your Socius application.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. A GUI similar to the one below should appear within a few seconds.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:wrench: **Help:**
If double-click does not work, you can go to the terminal and type in `java -jar Socius.jar`. Ensure that the terminal is in the directory of the `Socius.jar` file.
</div>

   ![Ui](images/Quickstart.png)

* Note that the app comes with some sample data by default. Type **`clear`** in the command box to remove those sample data.

* Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.
Some example commands you can try:
    * **`add`** `n/Amy Tan tg/W08 nat/Singaporean` : Adds a contact named `Amy Tan` to list, together with her tutorial group and nationality.

    * **`delete`** `3` : Deletes the person at index 3 in the current list.

    * **`find`** : `g/f nat/Singaporean` : Finds contacts of all female Singaporeans.

    * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

    * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

* Refer to the next section on [Features](#features) for more details of each command. Alternatively, you can go to [Command Summary](#command-summary) for an overview of all commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If only one parameter is expected but multiple ones are specified, only the last will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (`help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Viewing help: `help`

You can view the full list of commands available on Socius with the `help` command.

Format: **`help`**

![Help Command](images/HelpCommand.png)
*After execution of Help Command: **`help`***

### Adding a person: `add`

If you want to add a new person into Socius, you can use the `add` command.

Format: **`add`** `n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [nat/NATIONALITY] [g/GENDER] [tg/TUTORIAL_GROUP] [s/SOCIAL_HANDLE]…​ [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
The [Parameter Constraints](#parameter-constraints) section shows the constraints for each parameter.
</div>

* Only the `NAME` field of a person is _compulsory_, other fields are _optional_.
* The order of the fields does not matter.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0) and social handles (including 0)
</div>

Examples:

* **`add`** `n/Amy Tan` adds `Amy Tan` to the list.
* **`add`** `n/Benedict p/98765432 e/ben@example.com g/M` adds `Benedict`  to the list together with his phone number, email and gender.

* Input tag will be appended to the existing tag.
* If duplicated tags are given, these tags will not be added.
* At least one `TAG` must be provided.
* `TAG` is case-sensitive

For example:

* **`addt`** `2 t/teammate t/neighbour` adds the teammate and neighbour tags to the person at index 2 in the displayed person list.

Alternatively, **`addt`** `all t/TAG [t/TAG]…​`
* Add tags to everybody in the list.
* Input tag will be appended to the existing tag.
* If duplicated tags are given, these tags will not be added.
* At least one `TAG` must be provided.
* `TAG` is case-sensitive

For example:

* **`addt`** `all t/friend` followed by **`find`** `g/f` adds the friend tag to all persons in the filtered list of female contacts.
* **`addt`** `all t/teammate t/neighbour` adds the teammate and neighbour tags to all persons in the displayed person list.
![result for 'addt all t/teammate t/neighbour'](images/AddTagsToAll.png)

  * For `s/SOCIAL_HANDLE`, you can specify which social handle to remove by only leaving the `USERID` part empty (i.e. `s/PLATFORM:`)
* If duplicated fields are given, only the latest one will be taken
  * This does not applies to `s/SOCIAL_HANDLE` and `t/TAG` as they can accept multiple values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be replaced (i.e adding of tags is not cumulative).
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can change the default colour of the tag with `t/TAG:#HEX_COLOUR`<br>

the data of your previous Socius home folder.

**Q**: Can I edit the data file directly?<br>
**A**: Socius data are saved as a JSON file (i.e. `JAR_FILE_LOCATION/data/addressbook.json`).
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If the format of your data file is invalid, Socius will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
