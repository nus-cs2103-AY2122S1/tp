_What is BogoBogo?_{: .text-gamma}

BogoBogo is a **desktop app for small business owners to manage inventories, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI)**
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, BogoBogo can get your
inventory management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

With BogoBogo, business owners can:

1. manage inventories
2. record customer orders
3. track profit, costs, and revenue

      <p>Words in <code>{}</code> are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
      e.g. in <code>add {name}</code>, <code>name</code> is a parameter which can be used as <code>add milk</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Parameter prefixes such as <code>sp/</code> and <code>cp/</code> are special keywords that indicate a start of a parameter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Parameters in <code>()</code> are optional.<br>
      e.g. in <code>add {name} (c/{count})</code>, the <code>count</code> parameter can be omitted from the command.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Items in <code>[]</code> with <code>|</code>(vertical slash) are exclusively optional (user must specify at least one of the options).<br>
      e.g. <code>delete [{name} | id/{id_number}]</code> should be supplied with either <code>name</code> or <code>id number</code>.</p>
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If a parameter is expected only once in the command is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of
      the parameter will be taken.<br>

</div>

![clear](images/screenshots/clear.png)

## Managing orders

Orders is BogoBogo's way of tracking sold items. Users can create orders, process, and save them for later review. By
processing an order, the revenue attained will be added into total revenue which can then be used to calculate profits.

<div class="code-example bg-grey-lt-000">
:exclamation: Be sure not to close BogoBogo without saving your order! Any unsaved order will be lost. 
</div>

The workflow of the order system is as follows:
* Use `sorder` to enter ordering mode.
* Use `iorder` to add items into your order.
* Use `corder` to remove items from your order.
* Use `eorder` to place your order.
* Use `list order` to see current items in your order (see [`list`](#listing-items-list)).

## FAQ

**Q**: What is total profit, cost and revenue?<br>
**A**: Total cost is the total amount of money incurred from adding items to the inventory. Revenue is the total amount
of money gained from successfully receiving orders and selling items. Profit = Revenue - Cost.

**Q**: I just started using the app. Why is there a lot of cost incurred in my bookkeeping?<br>
**A**: When you use the app for the first time, it comes with sample inventory, and the bookkeeping will reflect the costs
of the items inside this sample inventory. If you would like to start afresh, please use the `clear` command.

**Q**: What's the difference between remove and delete?<br>
**A**: `delete` is meant for items wrongly added into the inventory. BogoBogo retracts an item cost when an item 
is deleted. `remove`, on the other hand, is for items added but not sold (e.g. expired goods). Because the item is 
correctly added, cost is still incurred.

<div class="code-example bg-grey-lt-000">
:exclamation: BogoBogo only retracts the costs of unsold items. If items are sold, cost will forever be incurred!
</div>

**Q**: I have edited the cost price of my item. Why isn't the change reflected in my total cost?<br>
**A**: BogoBogo adds the cost of an item to the total cost only upon the addition of the item into the inventory. Any
changes to cost price is assumed to be for future restocking of the item.<br>

**Q**: Why can't I edit the count of an item with `edit`?<br>
**A**: Due to the calculation of total cost and revenue, BogoBogo needs to know the reason for the change in count.
Use `add` for stocking items, `delete` to delete accidentally added items, `remove` to remove unsold items (e.g. expired
goods), and `iorder` to account for sold items.

**Q**: Why does `find t/baked t/popular` still show items that only have `t/baked` as a tag (not both)?<br>
**A**: `find t/baked t/popular` means "please find items that have either baked OR popular as a tag", not "please find
items that have both baked AND popular as tags"

**Q**: Why can't I see my cost prices in my past transactions?<br>
**A**: Past transactions only store important transaction related details. Storing cost price can be misleading since costs can change over time!

**Q**: My business is really growing lately, why does my BogoBogo calculation of revenue, profit, and cost seem wrong?<br>
**A**: BogoBogo was built for small businesses in mind. On that note, it doesn't calculate revenue and cost beyond $999,999,999. 
Consider hiring an accountant, you billionaire!
