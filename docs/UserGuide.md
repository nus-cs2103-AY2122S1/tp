## Introduction to Socius

Socius is a desktop application that helps you, as a CS2103T Software Engineering student, to
* manage your classmates’ contacts,
* make friends, and
* find teammates!

Socius provides these main features:
* Access details of students taking CS2103T.
* Find any student with name, tutorial group, nationality, tags, and more.
* Add suitable tags to categorize students.
* View nationality statistics of a tutorial class.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
Socius is optimized for use via a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. If you can
type fast, Socius can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional *GUI* apps.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using this guide

This user guide familarises you with all the latest features of Socius, enabling you to get the most out of Socius!

If you are a **new user**, this guide provides you with all the basic knowledge to [get started](#quick-start) with Socius.

If you are an **experienced user**, a [Command Summary](#command-summary) table is available at the end of the user guide for your reference.

Before exploring the features of Socius, you should be familiar with these symbols used in this user guide.

| Symbol | Meaning |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

Here is a quick start on how to use Socius on your computer.

1. Ensure you have [*Java 11*](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) installed on your computer.

2. Download the latest `Socius.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/releases).

3. Move the `Socius.jar` file to a folder you want to use as the home folder for Socius.

4. Double-click the file to start Socius. A GUI similar to the one below should appear within a few seconds.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:wrench: **Help:**
If double-clicking does not work, you can use the Terminal and type `java -jar Socius.jar`. Ensure that the Terminal is in the same directory as the `Socius.jar` file.
</div>

   ![Ui](images/Quickstart.png)

* Note that the app comes with some sample contacts by default. Type **`clear`** in the command box to remove those sample contacts.

* Type your command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute the command. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.
These are some example commands that you can try:
    * **`add`** `n/Amy Tan nat/Singaporean tg/W08` : Adds a person named Amy Tan, a Singaporean from tutorial group W08 to your contacts.

    * **`delete`** `3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * **`find`** : `g/f nat/Singaporean` : Finds all female Singaporeans from your contacts.

    * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

    * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

    * **`exit`** : Exits from Socius.

* Refer to the next section on [Features](#features) for more details of each command. Alternatively, you can refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary) for an overview of all commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Tan`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Tan t/friend` or as `n/John Tan`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but was specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (`help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
The [Parameter Constraints](#parameter-constraints) section shows the constraints for each parameter.
</div>
