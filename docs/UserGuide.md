# **Introduction**

![Ui](images/ailurusLogo.png)

Ailurus is a **desktop application** designed to aid Organising Committees from the Computing Faculty in managing and accounting for their administrative concerns. It provides users with the ability to plan and manage events and tasks for their members.

Ailurus is catered for people that are familiar with [Command Line Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLI), and are able to type fast. It also preserves the benefits of a [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (GUI) via [JavaFX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX).

# [**How to use the Ailurus User Guide**](#table-of-contents)

This User Guide aims to introduce new users to Ailurus, while also providing them with a comprehensive guide to all the commands in Ailurus.

Texts highlighted in light-blue such as [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_(computer_programming)) will direct the user to areas where more information about the highlighted text can be found. This is useful especially when you want to navigate to a certain section via the Table of Contents.

It is recommended to follow along and try out the commands listed in this User Guide. Ailurus is designed such that the commands will come as intuitive after a short period of use.

It is also <u>highly recommended</u> for first time users to read the `Notes about the command format` in [Features](#features), as well as the descriptions of each subsection, to understand what each group of command does.

# [**Quick start**](#table-of-contents)

1. Ensure you have [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `ailurus.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Ailurus.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will 
open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`mlist`** : Lists all members in Ailurus.

   * **`madd /n John Doe /ph 98765432 /em johnd@example.com /a John street, block 123, #01-01`**: Adds a contact named `John Doe` to Ailurus.

   * **`mdel /m 3`** : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list of people.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [**Navigating the User Interface**](#table-of-contents)

![NavigateUI](images/navigateUI.png)

The User Interface consists of the following components, as shown in the numberings of the components in the image above, on the top left-hand corner of each component:
1. The `File` button, when clicked, shows the `Exit` button which exits the application when clicked. Alternatively, the `X` cross at the top right-hand corner of the application can be used as well to exit.
2. The `Help` button, which clicked, shows the `Help F1` button which pops up the [Help Window](#viewing-help--help). This can also be done using the `help` command or pressing the `F1` key on the keyboard.
3. This is the **command input box**, which is the primary component that you will be working with. You can type in any of the commands found in the [Features](#features) section, as long as they have the valid parameters as well.
4. This is the **result display box**, which will give you feedback on the success or failure in executing a command. 
   1. If there is a mistake or error in your parameters, what you have typed in will turn red, and it will provide you with the expected format or constraints of the parameter that was invalid. ![InvalidInput](images/invalid_input.png)
   2. Note that it _may not show all invalid parameters_, so you should change them one at a time to check their validity.
5. This is the **Event List**, which will list events based on the [event commands used](#event). Each event has a date, and can have members participating in them who can be marked present or absent in the event.
6. This is the **Member List**, which will list members based on the [member commands used](#member). Each member card also shows their relevant details and tasks.
7. This is the **Task List**, which will list tasks based on the [task commands used](#task). Each task has a due date and time, and can be marked completed or incomplete.

# [**Features**](#table-of-contents)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Commands are usually abbreviated to facilitate faster typing for your convenience. As a general rule of thumb, `m`, `e` and `t` are used to represent `Member`, `Event` and `Task` respectively.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied.<br>
  e.g. in `madd /n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `madd /n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `/n NAME [/p POSITION]` can be used as `/n John Doe /p friend` or as `/n John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[/p POSITION]…​` can be completely absent (i.e. 0 times), `/p friend`, `/p friend /p family` etc.

* All prefixes that are provided must be followed by a space and a non-empty parameter. <br> There are exceptions to this rule: 
  * `/p ` prefix in `medit`
  * `/m ` prefix in `eedit`
  * `/att` and `/abs` in `mlist`
  * `/ovd` in `tlist`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `/n NAME /ph PHONE`, `/ph PHONE /n NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `/ph 12341234 /ph 56785678`, only `/ph 56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `elist` and `exit`) will be ignored.
  <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<span id="invalid_prefix" />
* If an invalid prefix is used in a command, it will be seen as part of the previous parameter and may throw an error. <br> e.g. if you specify `madd /n John Tan /w Street 52 /ph 91234556`, the name of member added will be `John Tan /w Street 52` which is invalid as `/` is not an alphabet or number.

* Some commands require you to enter the `EVENT_INDEX`, `MEMBER_INDEX` or `TASK_INDEX`. The `INDEX` refers to the order on 
  the display list.<br>
  e.g. `Freshmen Orientation Camp Project` has a `EVENT_INDEX` of `1`, `Charlotte Tan` has a `MEMBER_INDEX` 
  of `3`, and `submit indemnity forms` has a `TASK_INDEX` of `2` according to the diagram below.

## [**Member**](#table-of-contents)

The member list is in the centre column of the application, which lists all members and is scrollable. Each member has their own task list. Members have their own member card which consists of their relevant details, which include (from top to bottom):
* Name of member
* Positions of member
* Phone number
* Address
* Email Address
* Tasks belonging to member - <span style="color:#7c0236">red indicating undone</span>, <span style="color:#3f7318">green indicating done</span>. Note that the default is <span style="color:#7c0236">undone</span>.

The member list and the members can be changed using the various commands listed below. Each command starts with `m` abbreviation of member. This is to indicate that the command is used for the manipulation of the member list or member data.

### [Member Glossary](#table-of-contents)

* When editing positions, the existing positions of the member will be removed i.e. adding of positions is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the member’s positions by typing `/p` without specifying any positions after it. In such a case, only one `/p` prefix is allowed, otherwise the second `/p` prefix will be considered an [invalid prefix](#invalid_prefix) and will throw an error.
* After executing the command, the entire list of members will also appear in Member List. (same as `mlist`)

Examples:
* `medit /m 1 /ph 91234567 /em johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st member to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
