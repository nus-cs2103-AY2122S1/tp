ProfBook is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ProfBook can get your
contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. ProfBook helps CS2103 Instructors manage both students
and TAs contacts within teams and tutorial groups. It is optimized for CLI users so that tasks can be done in bulk especially when dealing with huge number of contacts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items in curly brackets indicate that one of the items should be chosen, with each item option separated using `|`.<br>
e.g. `n/NAME {r/student|r/tutor}` can be used as `n/NAME r/student` or `n/NAME r/tutor`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.


* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `undo`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book.

Format: `list`

### View Statistics of last searched list : `stat`

Shows a count of the tags, type and tutorial ID of the last searched list

Format: `stat`

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed and new tags will be added i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* The Editing of NUSNET_ID also changes the Email automatically.

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567 N/e0000000` Edits the phone number of the 1st person to be `91234567` and the NUSNET_ID to be `E0000000` and the email to become `e0000000@u.nus.edu`.

Format: `find {n/|s/|N/|g/|T/|r/|p/|a/|t/full/|t/}KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g friend will also match Friend or FrIend or FRIEND.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* All attributes can be searched, by specifying the prefix before the keyword.
* Partial matching can be done for all attributes except Tutorial ID and Role e.g. for name, Han will match Hans.
* Partial matching is performed from the first letter of each value, i.e. `find n/o` will return Charlotte Oliveiro since Oliveiro starts with 'o', but will not return Alex Yeoh or Roy Balakrishnan since they do not contain values starting with the specified key.
* Tags can be searched either using full or partial matching, using `t/full/` for full keyword matching and `t/` for partial matching. The first key to be searched should appear right after the prefix, e.g. `find t/full/friends`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
 e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find n/Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, and `Bo Yang`
* `find t/friend` will return all the contacts with the tag `friend`
* `find T/01` returns `Alex Yeoh`
* `find t/frien` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `Bernice Yu`

> Undo successful
> Remaining undo count: 2

Format: `undo`

### Redoing a command: `redo`

Re-performs a command that was undone. `redo` can redo any undone command up to the last executed command; executing a command that is not `undo` or `redo` will clear the redo history.

After executing the `redo` command, the remaining number of commands that can be redone is displayed. For example, the following output shows that there are 3 more commands that can be redone.

> Undo successful
> Remaining undo count: 3

Format: `redo`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.
