## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. You can check what version of Java you have by following this guide [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html).

2. Download the latest `HRManager.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your HR Manager.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type a command in the command box, which is the box that says "Enter command here...", and press Enter to execute it. e.g., typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

* **`list_c`** : Lists all candidates.

* **`add_c`**`name=Bryan Seah email=bsah@gmail.com phone=12345678 address=311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 position=Project Manager` : Adds a contact named `Bryan Seah` to the HR Manager.

* **`delete_c`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd candidate shown in the current candidate list.

* **`clear`** : Deletes all candidates, positions, interviews.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

WARNING: Please note that `clear` is an irreversible command and all existing data will be permanently deleted.

</div>

* **`exit`** : Exits the app.

* Refer to [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `<UPPER_CASE>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g., in `add_c name=<NAME>`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_c name=John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g., `name=<NAME> [tag=<TAG>] [status=<STATUS>]` can be used as `name=John Doe tag=friend status=scheduled` or as `name=John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g., `[position=<POSITION>]...​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `position=Accountant`, `position=Accountant position=Bookkeeper` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `name=<NAME> phone=<PHONE_NUMBER>`, `phone=<PHONE_NUMBER> name=<NAME>` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g., if you specify `phone=12341234 phone=56785678`, only `phone=56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Feature: Storage

Save information of all candidates, positions and interviews into a data file locally, on your device itself.

Modification of any information will be recorded immediately.

They will be saved in `data` folder in separate files: `/data/candidates.json`, `/data/positions.json`, and `/data/interviews.json`.

Note that `data` will be in the same folder as HR Manager.

If any entry from any of the data files is invalid, HR Manager will launch without any data entries.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

>:exclamation: **Caution:** <br>
The remaining segment for storage is for advanced users, regarding how the storage component is implemented.

</div>

The candidate, position and interview information will be saved using the JSON format below.

For a candidate,
```json
 [{
  "name" : "Charlotte Oliveiro",
  "phone" : "93210283",
  "email" : "charlotte@example.com",
  "address" : "Blk 11 Ang Mo Kio Street 74, #11-04",
  "remark" : "",
  "tagged" : [ "rejected" ],
  "positions" : [{
    "title" : "Assistant",
    "positionStatus" : "OPEN"
  }]
}]
```

For a position,

```json
[{
  "title" : "HR Manager",
  "positionStatus" : "OPEN"
}]
```

For an interview,

```json
[{
  "position" : "HR Manager",
  "candidateIDs" : [ "-550871537", "-2024498055" ],
  "date" : "18/10/2021",
  "startTime" : "1400",
  "duration" : "120",
  "status" : "PENDING"
}]
```
*Note that an interview does not save a candidate but its unique ID generated within the application.*

Certain fields are editable directly without repercussions <U>as long as the format is valid (as shown above)</U>, like **date**, **startTime**, **duration** and **status** in `Interviews.json`
However, the same cannot be said for fields of different files sharing the same information, like **positions** in `Candidates.json` and the entire `Positions.json` file.
Any discrepancy could cause HR Manager to display misrepresented information.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

>:exclamation:**Caution:** <br>
In general, modifying stored data directly is strongly discouraged.

If your changes to the data file made its format invalid, HR Manager will discard all stored data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQs
**Q**: When will my data be saved? <br>
**A**: Your data will be automatically saved after any command.

**Q**: How can I export my data? <br>
**A**: You can copy the save files, `/data/candidates.json`, `/data/positions.json`, and `/data/interviews.json`
and transfer it to another system's 'data' folder. <br>
Or better yet, copy the entire `/data` folder and overwrite the data folder of the system you wish to transfer to.
The transferred save files can then be loaded readily when using this application.
