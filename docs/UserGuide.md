Dash is a personal planner app which offers unparalleled speed using text-based input. It supports both management of
tasks and contacts. Dash is tailored to the needs of university students, who must keep track of a slew of different 
deadlines, commitments, and contacts. So long as you're a fast typist, Dash provides a blisteringly quick way to stay 
on top of your responsibilities.

This guide was written to help you set up and start using Dash. You can navigate by clicking the table of 
contents [below](#table-of-contents). If you're a new user, the Quick Start guide has all you need to get started. If 
you're an intermediate user looking to get more out of Dash, all supported commands are listed below.

## <u>Setting up Dash</u>

Whether you're using Windows or macOS, the steps for installation are the same.

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. 
   [Not sure what Java is? Click here!](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)

2. Download the latest `dash.jar` from [this website](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.4).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Dash, which is where your data is stored.
   -  _We suggest creating a folder called "Dash" and putting the `dash.jar` file inside it. You can place this folder 
      wherever you want. Next, we recommend that you create a shortcut for Dash by right-clicking on the `dash.jar` 
      file. On Windows, click on the `Create Shortcut` option while on macOS, click on `Make Alias`. You can then put 
      this shortcut in a convenient place (such as your Desktop) for easy access._


4. Double-click the file to start the app. Here's what you should see in a few seconds:<br>

5. That's all you need to do for the setup. To get started writing commands, refer to the Getting Started section 
   [below](#getting-started).

## <u>Getting Started</u>

Dash supports contact and task management in several ways. 
In terms of contact management, Dash allows you to add contacts and fill in details such as their 
phone number, address, and email. 
It even allows you to group them using tags such as "Neighbour" or "Colleague", so you can look them up more easily. 
For task management, Dash allows you to add tasks, tag them, and set deadlines for them. 
Once you're done with a task, you can mark it as complete.

Dash uses a tab system to keep your contacts and tasks separate. 
To view and edit your contact list, you must switch to the contacts tab. 
Similarly, to view and edit your task list, you must switch to the tasks tab. 
Finally, the help tab provides you with a quick summary of Dash's features and how to use them.

![Switching Tabs](images/UG-01.png)

Dash uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) to optimize speed. This means that you use mostly your keyboard to interact 
with Dash, instead of relying on your mouse to click on options. For example, you can switch tabs by typing in a 
command; you cannot do so by clicking the tab.

Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open 
the help window.

Some example commands you can try:

* **`contacts`** : Switches to the contacts tab

* **`tasks`** : Switches to the tasks tab

* **`add n/Joe`** : Adds a contact named Joe.

* **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

* **`exit`** : Exits the app.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: You can press the up and down arrow keys in the command box to retrieve your 10 previous commands. This can save 
you a lot of time!

Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## <u>Features</u>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

<a name="command-format-info"></a>
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Command words (like `add`, `find`, `help`, etc.) are always lowercase and are case-sensitive.
  e.g. `Help` will not be understood by Dash, but `help` will. 

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used more than once.<br>
  e.g. `p/PERSON_INDEX…` can be used as `p/1`, `p/1 p/3`, `p/4 p/5 p/2` etc.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times, because of the square brackets), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` 
  etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of 
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `contacts`, `tasks` and `clear`) 
  will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

:scroll: Notes:

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.

  * e.g. `find n/Hans Bo` will return only `Hans Bo` and `Hans Bo the Second`. It will not return `Hans Gruber` or
    `Bo Yang`.
  * e.g. `find p/86235343 t/CS2101` will return only contacts who have both the phone number `86235343` AND the tag 
    `CS2101`. It will not return contacts with different phone numbers, even if they both have the tag `CS2101`.

<a name="contacts-panel-info"></a>
**:information_source: Notes on the Contacts panel:**
On the Tasks tab, there is a Contacts panel on the right that shows a simplified view of your Contacts tab. If you 
filtered your contacts by using the _Find_ command before switching to the Tasks tab, the Contacts panel shows the same 
filtered contact list. In this way, if you have a lot of contacts, you can maintain a focused view of the current people
of interest and more easily assign them to tasks.

**:information_source: Notes about specifying Date and Time:**
A task can optionally have a Date, or both a Date and a Time.

`add [dt/DATE] [dt/TIME] [dt/DATE, TIME]`

* When only Date is specified in the _Add_ command, a task will only have the specified Date.
* When only Time is specified in the _Add_ command, a task will have today's Date and the specified Time.
* When both Date and Time are specified in the _Add_ command, a task will have both of the specified Date and Time.

`edit [dt/DATE] [dt/TIME] [dt/DATE, TIME]`

* When only Date is specified in the _Edit_ command, a task will only have its Date changed to the specified Date.
* When only Time is specified in the _Edit_ command, a task will only have its Time changed to the specified Time.
* When both Date and Time are specified in the _Edit_ command, a task will have both of its Date and Time changed to the specified Date and Time.

**:warning: Multiple Date/Time parameters:**<br>
All commands that accept Date/Time parameters (_Add_, _Edit_, _Find_ commands) expect only one Date/Time parameter. 
If you specify multiple Date/Time parameters, only the last Date/Time parameter will be taken.<br>
e.g. if you specify `dt/12/02/2021 dt/1900`, only `dt/1900` will be taken.
