HeRon is a desktop application for HR managers of Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to assist them in managing HR administrative tasks such as tracking leaves and offs, calculating pay and updating payroll information. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a fast typer, HeRon can get your tasks done faster as compared to traditional GUI apps.

This User Guide will bring you through the features that HeRon has to offer, as well as the commands to make use of them.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Please read this information panel for more information on commands before proceeding.**

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets `i.e. []` are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### General Admin Features

#### Import Data from CSV files: `import`

Imports the data from a specified `.csv` file.

Format: `import FILEPATH`
* Imports data from the specified filepath, which can be absolute or relative (to the `.jar` application).
* Only one `FILEPATH` should be specified.
* Filepaths should be written following the current Operating System being used. (e.g. `\My Folder\myData.csv` for Windows; `/My Folder/myData.csv` for MacOS/Linux).
* Filepaths with spaces present in directory can be written as per usual (e.g. `./My Folder/toBeImported.csv`).
* A header row is required to indicate the purpose of the various fields, and it must be the first row in the `.csv` file.
* No specific ordering of the columns is required.
* Ensure that the header rows of the respective fields in the `.csv` file are labelled according to the naming convention in the table below, and are present in the data if compulsory.
* If multiple compulsory fields are missing, the app only alerts the user of the first instance of a missing field which is compulsory.
* If there are duplicate `Person` entries, `Email` or `Contact Number`, the import will not be allowed.
* Ensure that each field follows the specifications required, which can be found in the section for [`add` command](UserGuide.md#adding-an-employee-add).
* Ensure that the number of fields in each entry matches the number of headers.
* If multiple tags are present for an entry, they should be separated by `/`.
* For non-compulsory fields, if no value is provided, the field for the entry in HeRon would be set to the default value.
* If a value for a field is provided for at least one entry, then all other entries must also have their respective values for the field provided.

* Edits the employee at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the employee will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the employee’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.
* The values you provide to the command must be valid. For information on which values are valid, you may refer to the table under the [`add` command](UserGuide.md#adding-an-employee-add) for more information.
* **NOTE:** The edit command is unable to directly edit the dates of leaves taken by employees.
Refer to the `assignLeave` and `removeLeavesBefore` commands below instead to edit the dates.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com l/15` Edits the phone number, email address and leaves of the 1st employee to be `91234567`, `johndoe@example.com` and `15` respectively.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Deleting an employee : `delete`

Deletes the specified employee from the application.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* The index cannot exceed the length of the employee list.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd employee in HeRon.
* `find n/Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st employee in the results of the `find` command.

#### Locating specific employees: `find`

Find employees using specified fields, checking if their information field contains any of the given keywords / queries.

Format: `find [STATUS] [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/ROLE] [l/NUMBER_OF_LEAVES] [d/DATE] [s/HOURLYSALARY] [hw/HOURS_WORKED] [o/OVERTIME] [t/TAG]...`

* At least one field should be specified.
* The order of the fields do not matter except for the `[STATUS]` field, which must come right after `find`.
* To search a field with multiple values, separate each value with a space after their respective tag.
  * Example: Use `find n/Alice Charlotte` to search for `Alice` or `Charlotte` in the `name` field.
* The filters work differently for each field and can be generalised to 4 types of queries, described below. A single find command can contain all 4 types of queries at once.
  * **Type 1 Query: Keyword Matching**
    * Fields: `n/NAME`, `p/PHONE`, `e/EMAIL`, `a/ADDRESS`, `r/ROLE`, `t/TAG`
      * These fields will find all people who contain the given keywords in their respective fields. They are not case-sensitive.
      * The exceptions are:
         * `p/PHONE` field, which only find exact matches.
         * `n/NAME` field, which can find matches when a complete part (first/middle/last) of a name is given. (e.g. For name "Charlotte Oliverio", both `n/Charlotte` and `n/Oliverio` works, but `n/Char` or `n/Oliver` will not)
    * For example, `find p/91234567 e/alice bob r/Admin` will find anyone who satisfies all the following 3 criteria:
      1. has the phone number 91234567,
      2. whose email contains `alice` or `bob`, and
      3. whose role contains `Admin`.

  * **Type 2 Query: Value Based Comparison**
    * Fields: `hw/HOURS_WORKED`, `l/NUMBER_OF_LEAVES`, `s/HOURLYSALARY`, `o/OVERTIME`
      * These fields must be specified with a comparison and a value to compare the respective field to. Valid comparisons are
        * `>`: more than
        * `>=`: more than or equal to
        * `=`: equal to
        * `<`: less than
        * `<=`: less than or equal to

    * For example, `find hw/>=10 l/<7` will find anyone who satisfies the both of the following 2 criteria:
      1. has worked more than or exactly 10 hours, and
      2. has less than 7 days of leave left (e.g. 6 and below)

    * You cannot enter more than 1 comparison or value to compare to. For example, `find hw/<10 >5` is not valid.
  
    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

  * **Type 3 Query: Status Based Filter**
    * There are no fields attached to this query. Instead, specific keywords are available for use.
      * These status keywords must be used right after `find` and cannot be used after a field is specified (for example `n/`).
      * Keywords available include:
        * `unpaid`
        * More to be added.
    * For example, `find unpaid` will find all employees who are considered unpaid.

  * **Type 4 Query: Date Based Comparison**
    * Fields: `d/DATE`
      * This field will find all people who have taken a leave on a given date or within a range of dates. (start and end dates inclusive)
      * There are two ways to search using dates: individual dates or date ranges.
        * For individual dates, simply type in a date of the form YYYY-MM-DD.
        * For date ranges, simply type in two dates in the form YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD.
      * Both individual dates and date ranges can be combined into one query.
    * For example, `find d/2021-10-10 2021-11-01:2021-11-05` will find anyone who satisfies **either** of the following 2 criteria:
      1. has taken a leave on October 10th 2021, or
      2. has taken a leave between the dates November 1st 2021 and November 5th 2021, start and end dates inclusive.

* For each field, you can search using multiple keywords by separating each keyword with a space, in the same field.
  * For example, `find n/John Mike` will return all employees whose name contains either John or Mike.
  
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Examples:
* `find unpaid n/John Mike r/admin l/<=5 o/>3` finds all employees who satisfy all the following criteria:
  1. is considered unpaid in the system,
  2. whose name is either John or Mike,
  3. whose role contains the word `admin`,
  4. has 5 or less than 5 leaves, and
  5. has strictly more than 3 days of overtime
* `find unpaid n/carl Elle l/<3` returns `Carl Kurz`, `Elle Meyer` as long as they have less than 3 leaves left and are still unpaid.<br>

where `OVERTIMEPAYRATE` is the added pay rate for overtime as compared to normal work hours.<br>
It can be viewed through the `viewOvertimePayRate` command or changed through the `setOvertimePayRate` command.

Format: `startPayroll`
* Calculates the payroll of **all employees regardless of current viewing list** based on the formula above.
* After that, marks all employees as awaiting payment of the calculated amount.
<br>This will produce red labels under each employee data stating 'NOT PAID' and the amount they are owed.
* The number of hours worked and overtime hours worked for the employee will be reset to 0 as well
  so that hours counting towards the next payroll can continue to be added.
* Finally, display the list of all employees.
* This command is typically followed up by `pay` commands to mark employees as paid,
  after their salaries are given in real life.

Example:
* Before `startPayroll` command, currently viewing a filtered list.
  ![before starting payroll](images/user-guide/startPayroll_before.png)


* After `startPayroll` command, payroll have been calculated and currently viewing the full list of employees.
  ![after starting payroll](images/user-guide/startPayroll_after.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes:**

* All employees must not have any pay pending from the previous payroll (i.e. no red 'NOT PAID' label). Otherwise, an error will be thrown
  and no action will be taken.
* To start a new payroll, first make sure to pay all employees using the `pay` command.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Paying employee(s) : `pay`

Marks the specified employee, or all employees in the current list, as paid.

Format 1: `pay INDEX` - for paying a specific employee
* Simulates the paying of an employee by clearing the salary owed to the employee by setting it back to 0. This clears the red
  `NOT PAID` label under the employee's data.
* This command is typically used after the `startPayroll` command, which sets the pay owed to the respective employees.
  The pay command can then be followed after to clear the pay owed.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* The employee must have payment pending from a `startPayroll` command.

Example:
* `pay 1` marks the 1st employee in the Employee list as paid, clearing the pay owed to the employee and removing
  the red 'NOT PAID' label.
