// Stylesheet was taken from Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) so that we can make use of their components in our
// documentation.

// stylelint-disable indentation

// Hover mixin and `$enable-hover-media-query` are deprecated.
//
// Origally added during our alphas and maintained during betas, this mixin was
// designed to prevent `:hover` stickiness on iOSâ€”an issue where hover styles
// would persist after initial touch.
//
// For backward compatibility, we've kept these mixins and updated them to
// always return their regular psuedo-classes instead of a shimmed media query.

// Issue: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25195
