// Stylesheet was taken from Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) so that we can make use of their components in our

// Resize anything

@mixin resizable($direction) {
  overflow: auto; // Per CSS3 UI, `resize` only applies when `overflow` isn't `visible`
  resize: $direction; // Options: horizontal, vertical, both
}
