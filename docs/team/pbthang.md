### Project: Restaurant HR Helper

Restaurant HR Helper (RHRH) is a desktop application that helps organise and keep track of human resources and people related to the restaurant.
This includes neatly storing employees, suppliers, loyal customers information and reservations in the database to easily access them when needed.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add/delete/edit `Reservation` information (Pull Request [#54](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/54), [#92](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/92), and [#125](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/125))
  * What it does: Add/Edit/Delete an `Reservation` the same way it does a `Person` with the required and optional prefixes to the list of `Reservation`.
  * Highlights: These commands are later enhanced by [hernpiblo](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t17-1.github.io/tp/team/hernpiblo.html), where you can add reservations based on the current table setup of the restaurants as well as the timing availability.
  
* **New Feature**: Added the GUI for `Reservation` (Pull request [#88](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/88))
  * What it does: `Reservation` is separated into a separated view that you can switch to by clicking the menu <kbd>Reservations</kbd> option or by using the list reservation command.
  * Justifications: Since reservation might be expanded to hold more information in the future, instead of displaying them in `Customer` view, I decided to separate it to reduce clutter.
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to get the corresponding customer information who made a particular reservation (Pull request [#107](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/107))
  * What it does: From the display `Reservation` list, users can get the information of the customer who made a particular reservation
  * Justifications: Displaying customer information with reservation may result in cluttered user interface, data repetition and coupling in the codebase. Hence,this command helps user to easily navigate between a reservation and the corresponding customer information.
  
* **New Feature**: Implemented sorting order by date-time descending for `Reservation` list.
  * What it does: Reservations are sorted by descending date-time.
  * Justifications: Reservations should be in chronological order for easy referencing, and date-time descending order is chosen so that the latest reservations are always on top of the list.
