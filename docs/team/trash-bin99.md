### Introduction

I am a software developer for Financial Advisor Smart Tracker (FAST). I was placed in charge of ensuring the testing of 
FAST. When I was developing FAST, I was a Year 2 Computer Science Undergraduate.

### Project Overview: Financial Advisor Smart Tracker (FAST)

Financial Advisor Smart Tracker (FAST) is a desktop address book application targeted at financial advisors, for
them to keep track of their clients as contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with
JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

### Contributions to FAST

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### New Features

* `Tag` command feature

    * **What it does**:<br>
    The `Tag` command allows users to intuitively edit the tags of their clients.
    Users can add their own tags to clients or delete them.
    They can also add or delete the newly added priority tags and investment plan tags.
    The tags will then be displayed on the GUI, as part of the `PersonCard`.
  
  <br>

    * **Justification**:<br>
    While an existing command `edit` in AB3 already allows for the adding and deletion of tags,
    my team identified a need to make editing tags easier and simpler, as we were planning on
    augmenting the `tag` system, and the `edit` command handled too many parameters for it to be simple.
    As a result, I was tasked with the creation of the `tag` command.  
    
  <br>

    * **Highlights**: <br>
    Created the `tag` command, with only 2 operations: `add` and `delete`. This was so that the command would
    remain simple and easy to use for users. Inspiration for how the command was designed and created was taken
    from the pre-existing `edit` command, as it already had the functionality to delete and add tags. 
    <br> <br >However, further considerations were taken to further simplify the tag operations for users. For example,
    `edit` command will not save the previous state of the client's tags, instead overwriting the tags with any
    input tags. This was improved in the `tag` command, where previous tag state was preserved, and any changes made
    were applied to the previous state.

#### Enchancement to Existing Features

* `PriorityTags` and `InvestmentPlanTags` feature
  * **What it does**:<br>
    `PriorityTags` and `InvestmentPlanTags` are fixed types of tags, i.e. their name can not be edited by the user.
    They are used to assign a specific priority to a client, and to assign a specific investment plan to a client 
    respectively. These tags are also used by another feature `Statistics` to show relevant information to the user.

  <br>

  * **Justification**:<br>
    This feature allows users to assign to their clients specific tags that further help them to categorise their 
    clients. These tags are also used by another new command `sort`, to help users quickly find clients with the
    respective priorities or investment plans.

  <br>

  * **Highlights**: <br>
    These fixed tags are essentially tags and can be added or deleted similar to normal tags with the `add`, `edit` and
    `tag` command. In addition to the restraints placed on normal tags (including the fact that each user have only
    have one instance of each unique tag), each user can only have one priority tag. For example, a user may not have
    both the `Low Priority` and `High Priority` tag concurrently.
