### Project: WhereTourGo

**WhereTourGo (WTG)** is a desktop app for managing your tour contacts, optimized for use via a Command-Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a `filter` command to filter contacts by category.
    * What it does: This feature filters the contacts in the address book by category.
    * Justification: This feature allows users to find contacts based on a given criteria.
    * Highlights: This feature required careful consideration in the filtering mechanism and required the implementation of a new Predicate for the filtering mechanism.


* **New Feature**: Added a `view` command to display contact details one right panel.
    * What it does: This feature displays the details of the contact specified (by name or index) on the display panel.
    * Justification: This feature allows users to easily view contact details such as address, phone number, email, etc.
    * Highlights: This feature involved both the logic components and GUI components. The CommandResult had to be modified to trigger the display panel to display the contact specified.


* **New Feature**: Added a `undo` and `redo` command to restore previous versions of the address book.
    * What it does: This feature allows users to undo or redo previous commands that changes the data in the address book (e.g. `delete`, `edit`, `add`, `clear`, `sort`).
    * Justification: This feature allows users to rectify any unintended changes to the address book, especially commands that remove data from the address book such as `clear` and `delete`. Thus, allowing them to recover data.
    * Highlights: This feature required adding a system to keep track of the current address book and store the different versions of the address book every time a change is made. Additionally,the implementation needed to be able to support different commands.

* **Project management**
    * Reviewed and merged Pull Requests of other teammates.
    * Reviewed and fixed minor formatting errors in DG and UG.
  

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Reimplemented `clear` to disallow users from clearing an empty address book.
    * Added the option to `filter` by `Tag` and by multiple `CategoryCode` to increase flexibility.
    * Improved GUI by formatting the contact details in the display panel.


* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Contributed to User Guide Introduction and Purpose.
        * Added documentation for `filter`, `view`, `undo`, and `redo` feature. [\#34](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/34)

    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `filter`, `view`, `undo`, and `redo` command. [\#194](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/194)
        * Added use cases. [\#209](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/pull/209)
