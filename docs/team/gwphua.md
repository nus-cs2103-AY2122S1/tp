### Project: Ailurus

Ailurus helps to organize committee accounts for details of their members. It provides users with convenient viewing 
and editing access to all information, thus providing much convenience in their work. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### New Features
* Adding in display windows for Task and Event List.
   * What it does: Allows the user to view all 3 event lists: Event, Member, and Task.
   * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user is required to view and make further commands according to the index shown on the lists.
   * Highlights: There was much difficulty faced in making the cards on the GUI automatically update when the tags, which are shown in flow panes, are being changed due to member/task additions. 
   * Credits: FXML files that are edited with much help from SceneBuilder.

#### Enhancements to existing features
