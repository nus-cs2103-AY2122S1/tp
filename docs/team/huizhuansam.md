### Project: SPAM

SPAM is a desktop application that is made for fast-typing marketers to handle large quantities of marketing leads and
contacts efficiently and precisely. It is a CLI application that has UNIX-like command line syntax, and sports an
elegant and modern GUI created with JavaFX. The application is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Data encryption.
    * What it does: Secures data by encrypting files with a user-supplied password.
    * Justification: Marketers handle sensitive personal information of their leads. Adding a layer of security to
protect against unauthorised users and data leaks will give users a peace of mind.
    * Highlights: The encryption algorithm used is AES-256. 
    * Credits: [Encrypting and Decrypting Files in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-cipher-input-output-stream) by 
Baeldung. Adapted and modified.

* **Project management**:
