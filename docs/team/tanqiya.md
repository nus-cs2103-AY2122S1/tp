### Project: Teletubbies


Teletubbies is a desktop application developed and designed for telemarketers and telemarketing supervisors to help manage their customer contacts. Teletubbies allow users to create a checklist based on a set of customer contact data, with additional features such as tagging and viewing statistics to help improve their workflow.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the command to **import** contact files.
    * What it does: allows the user to import a JSON file containing contacts and replace the current contact list.
    * Justification: This feature simplifies the process of switching between data files because users can use the command to conveniently import a new file from a specified file location rather than manually editing the app's save file.

* **New Feature**: Added the command to **merge** contact files.
    * What it does: allows the user to merge contacts from a JSON file with the current contact list.
    * Added UUID to identify a contact across different lists and facilitate the process of merging if the contact's particulars have been edited.
    * Justification: This feature improves contact management as users such as telemarketing supervisors can manage different contact lists and merge them to update their master list.

* **New Feature**: Added an **export confirmation** command.
    * Displays the list of contacts to be exported. Allows users to view and confirm if the correct contacts have been selected before the export is executed.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tanqiya&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=tanqiya&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&zFR=false)

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.3` and `v1.4` on GitHub

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `import`.
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `import`, `merge` and `export` features.
        * Added UML diagrams for `merge` and `export`.

* **Community**:
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](https://github.com/tanqiya/ped/issues/7), [2](https://github.com/tanqiya/ped/issues/5))
