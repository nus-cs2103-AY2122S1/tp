### Project: TutorAid

TutorAid is a desktop application used for helping tech-savvy private tutors, who have busy schedules / many students, to keep track of each students' details. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
