### Project: ProfBook

ProfBook is an AddressBook Application targeted at CS2103 instructors to manage both students and TAs contacts within teams and tutorial groups. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **Enchancements ti the existing features:**
  * **Enhanced**: The `Add` feature allows the addition of a person to the ProfBook with both the old and new attributes.
    * Justification: This feature will be used to add new persons to the ProfBook
    * PRS: [\#52](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/pull/52), [\#182](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/pull/182), [\#188](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/pull/188)
  * **Enhanced**: The `Edit` feature allows the  editing of the old and new attributes of the person in the ProfBook.
    * Justification: This feature can be used by the Professor to change any incorrect data entered by mistake and to add or remove tags given to the contacts in the ProfBook.

  * **New Feature**: Added the `Bulk_Tag` feature allowing the user to tag all the contacts in the filtered person list of the ProfBook.
