### Project: gitGud

#### What is gitGud?

gitGud is a desktop application for managing friends' gaming information. gitGud uses a simple Graphical User Interface
(GUI) combined with an optimized Command Line Interface (CLI) to give you a smooth and efficient experience. If you can
type fast enough, gitGud can get you contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI-based applications.

* **New Features**:
    1. Created the structure and support for Games and GameFriendLinks
       - Created the necessary objects, lists, and integrated them into the gitGud's model. 
    2. Added the ability to get a friend contact.
       - What it does: allows the user to get all information linked to a friend contact.
       - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is now able to view all the information 
       about a friend at one place, which includes all the games and the respective in-game ids.

* **Testing**
    1. Wrote unit/integration tests for Game, GameFriendLink and related classes.
    2. Wrote unit/integration tests for get friend and get game command.
