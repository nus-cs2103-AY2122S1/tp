### Project: MyCRM

MyCRM is a desktop application for managing client contacts, repair job statuses, and product information that has been optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while maintaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type quickly, MyCRM can complete customer relationship management tasks faster than traditional GUI applications.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys and list out all previous commands using `history` command.
  

* **New Features**: Added a `printReport` command to generate a report of all jobs within current month.
    * What it does: Allows user to review all the jobs in current month by showing the jobs completed within current month
    , the jobs received within current month, the three most popular products received within current month,
      and a bar graph showing the last four months revenue in this year and last year in a new window.
    * Justification: This feature improves MyCRM significantly because a user can review monthly job records and statistics so that user can learn about the monthâ€™s performance and analyse how to improve.


* **New Features**: Added a `exportReport` command to export a report of all jobs  within current month.
    * What it does: Allows user to export the monthly job report generated by `printReport` command as a PDF format.
    * Justification: This feature improves MyCRM significantly because a user can either save the job report locally or print it out.
