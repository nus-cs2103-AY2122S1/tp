### Project: ModuLink

ModuLink is a desktop-based application for Computer Science (CS) students at NUS to facilitate finding teammates for group-based modules. It allows you to find students taking the modules you are interested in, search by their group status (to find students available to form or join groups), and much more. ModuLink has been developed using Java and has about 18k LoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to for a user to see all his/her favourited profiles.
  * What it does: allows the user to view all favourites. 
  * Justification: This feature was necessary as it had a significant importance in the purpose of our product. A user is highly likely to want to be able to view all favourited profiles as there would be too many profiles of little/no importance shown on the GUI. Scrolling through all profiles to find the few that are favourited would be very tedious.
  * Highlights: This enhancement does not affect existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was not too challenging as our team had the foresight to include helpful attributes in all profiles.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
