### Project: Uni-Fy

Uni-Fy is a desktop app for managing your university workload and it is designed by university students for university students. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Tasks appear green if the daily panel reflects the current date

* **New Feature**: Contributed to the Front End UI of the `show` feature, particularly the layout and design of the `Day Card`.
