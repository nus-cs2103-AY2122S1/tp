### Project: Uni-Fy

Uni-Fy is a desktop app for managing your university workload and it is designed by university students for university students. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
