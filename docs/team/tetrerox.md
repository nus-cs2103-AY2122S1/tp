### Project: Staff'd

Staffâ€™d is a desktop staff tracking application that manages F&B staff, their schedule and salaries. The user interacts 
with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to swap shifts between 2 staff.
  * _What it does_: Takes a shift from each of the 2 staff and swaps them between the 2 of them.
  * _Justification_: This allows staff to have flexibility in their work schedule to take breaks while not affecting the business. The user only has to input 1 command instead of using 2 `delete` and 2 `add` commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for the user to delete a shift from a staff's schedule.
  * _What it does_: It locates a staff with the given index or staff's name and deletes the shift with the given date and slot.
  * _Justification_: This command is necessary for the manager to manage his/her staff's shifts and overall schedule.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Modified the delete command to locate staff using their names and also to support mass deletion using staff role and status.
