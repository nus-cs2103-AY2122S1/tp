### Project: DonnaFin.io

DonnaFin.io is a desktop address book application used by financial advisors to keep track of their client information and related tasks.
This is a Java program with about 10 kloc with a JavaFX GUI.
The '.io' in our name is a reflection of our belief that you deserve a faster workflow for input and output.
If you can type fast, you can use our CLI-like commands to manage and view your notes, upcoming meetings and todo lists much faster than your typical customer relationship manager apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* Support passing instructions to `Ui` from `Commands`
  * Uses functional programming to hand a callback from the result of command execution (`CommandResult.uiAction : Consumer<Ui>`) that can perform the necessary side effect in `Ui`
  * Our application's front end is getting steadily more complex and our commands need to be able to execute actual functions on `Ui`. However, other solutions would require global variables or drilling down a reference to `Ui` into `Command`. A simpler and cleaner workaround was to use functions as a first class object to instruct `Ui` on the appropriate actions (show help / exit / show client view, etc)
  * Created when it was necessary to implement the `ClientView` mode in UI (Showing a single client's information in a dedicated view for the user to edit and interact with). [#67](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/67)

<br>

* Allow user to edit information directly in the Client View
  * The user must be able to cycle through the different attributes (presented in a row format), and edit as necessary.
    * Heavily refactor `ClientPanel` to support actual interactions with the `AttributePanel`s [#90](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/90)
    * Support user focus (highlight row when tabbing through) [#92](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/92)
    * Show user in an alert whenever edit fails, and for what field (e.g. put letters in the phone number field) [#95](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/95)
  * As this is a critical part of our functionality, we need this to be intuitive and easy to use.
  * Using `EventHandler`s to great effect within text fields to support highlighting outer parent elements.

<br>

* Add `SwitchTabCommand` that allows for CLI navigation through the different tabs. [#148](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/148)
  * User must easily be able to cycle through contact information, policy table, asset table etc
  * Needs to be a simple and easy to use command in the command bar.

<br>

* Create a generic class to create tables for Client View tabs on Polices, Assets, Liabilities to support future extension. [#125](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/125), [#154](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/154), [#156](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/156), [#195](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/195), [#250](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/250), [#268](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/268), [#361](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/361), [#190](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/190)
  * Create a JavaFX component that can create a fully functional and rich table for any data class.
  * Made the entire front end for the yet-to-be-completed `Policy`, `Asset` and `Liability` classes as they all share a similar format of being represented in a table.
  * Makes good use of software engineering principles:
    * Open-Closed Principle: Open for configuring and extension but closed to modification. All instances of `AttributeTable` is configured by `TableConfig` and `ColumnConfig` and `Aggregator` to accept any manner of data classes.
    * Encapsulate and support creation of configuration data class in a manner similar to many open source modules (e.g. JavaScript modules like axios);
  * Add a bare bones automated GUI testing with TestFX to ensure the class can be loaded, with a proper `Attribute` stub that can be used to populate values

<br>

* Re-organise application architecture by separating `Storage` and `Logic` [#18](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/18), [#17](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/17)
  * Improves overall architecture by decoupling `Storage` and `Logic` ensuring all `Storage` calls go through `Model` layer to follow the layered architecture style. (See:  [_O' Reilly_ Chapter 1. Layered Architecture](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch01.html))
  * The layered architecture design pattern was chosen over the current Model-View-Controller architecture in a previous team meeting to reduce complexity, simplify working on components and improve testability.

<br>

* Support `Policy`, `Asset`, and `Liability` with monetary values with a `Money` class. [#182](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/182), [#141](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/141)
  * Create a class that keeps track of monetary values, support arithmetic and can be converted to a valid '$' formatted string.
  * Update the attributes that require it to support these fields
  * Highlights
    * Integration Tests: Ensure that an attribute created with the invalid monetary formats should throw correctly: [#193](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/193), [#311](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/311)

<br>

* Add automated GUI tests for DonnaFin
  * Automated checks can be run on Gradle builds Github CI/CD to confirm validity of `.fxml` files and GUI logic.
  * Prevents unusable GUI changes from being added to the codebase.
  * Required spending a significant amount of time learning and understanding Java GUI testing with TestFx, adapting boilerplate and common functions from SE-EDU AB4. At all steps, this needed to support the new file structure and dependencies. [#132](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/132), [#134](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/134), [#352](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/352), [#353](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/353)
  * Adapted from the SE-EDU: Address Book 4 codebase
