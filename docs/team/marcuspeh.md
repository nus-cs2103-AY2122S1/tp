### Project: Around the World in $80

Around the World in $80 is a desktop application that splits bills between different contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 22 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to change between contacts and groups view.
  * What it does: Allows the user to see groups / contacts with a command.
  * Justification: This feature is crucial as the user should be able to view the groups and contacts created.
  * Highlights: This implementation added in a new command `groups` to see all groups. It changes the command `list` to `contacts`. `contacts` allows the user to see all contacts.

  * What it does: Allows for the splitting in expense between users of a group. Update `Expense` command to be more straight forward.

   * Pull request: [\#158](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/pull/158)
    
* **severity.HIGH** Commands for modifying groups will result in the entire group's expense to be wiped. [\#270](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/issues/270)
    * What happen: Expenses were not brought from the old instance to the new instance of that specific group.
    * Pull request: [\#269](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/pull/269), [\#273](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/pull/273)

* **severity.MED** Json files loads even when phone number of contacts is partially changed ie not all phone number of a contact is changed.
