### Project: gitGud

gitGud is a **desktop application for storing and managing your friends' gaming information and schedules**.
It is dedicated to gamers like you and provides a gamer-themed experience with a focus on increasing your efficiency through
its typing-based interface.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tau-bar&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=MarcusTXK&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Features**:
  1. Added the ability to add friends in [PR#48](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/48).
     - What it does: allows the user to add a friend to gitGud by adding the friend's unique `FRIEND_ID` and
            optionally, `FRIEND_NAME`. `Refactor - Enhancement`
     - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly, as it is a core feature, which allows the
            user to add the friend to gitGud to start planning their gaming schedule with that friend.
  2. Added the ability to delete friends and games.
     - What it does: allows the user to delete a friend from gitGud using the friend's unique `FRIEND_ID`. `Refactor - Enhancement`
     - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now delete a friend and games 
       from
              gitGud in the event that they made a mistake in the details or simply wishes to remove a friend or game.
  3. Restructured and styled the UI for v1.2, v1.3 and v1.4 to be in its current state with 2 lists, the friend list 
       and the game list, as well as a main card in the middle to display the requested information by the user in 
    [PR#145](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/145).
       - What it does:  allows the user to see details about a friend or a game when the user runs the `friend --get` 
         or `game --get` command.`New Feature`
       - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly, as one of the purposes of gitGud is to be 
         able to store and view your friends' data easily, such as their in-game usernames as well as their skill levels, 
         as well as the friend's availabilities, to make it easy for the user to choose who to play what game at what time.
         
* **Testing**
  1. Adapted the previous tests for our implementation of AddFriendCommand and DeleteFriendCommand in 
  [PR#48](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/48).

     classes in [PR#184](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/184).
  4. Conducted extensive manual testing for UI.
