### Introduction

I am a software developer for Financial Advisor Smart Tracker (FAST). I was in-charge of the Code Quality and Command component of FAST.
At the time of developing FAST, I was a Year 2 Computer Science Undergraduate.

### Project Overview: Financial Advisor Smart Tracker (FAST)

Financial Advisor Smart Tracker (FAST) is a desktop application targeted at financial advisors, for
them to keep track of their clients as contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with
JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

### Contributions to FAST

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### New Features

* **New Feature 1**: `Appointment` feature.
  * **What it does**:<br>
  The `Appointment` feature allows users to manage their appointment with their clients. 
  It allows user to store critical information such as date, time and venue.
  It also allows user to track the number of completed appointments with a client.
  In the situation where the user accidentally marks an appointment wrongly, he can unmark the appointment.
  It is integrated into the `PersonCard`, placed on the right-hand side of each client's details. 
  
  <br>
  
  * **Justification**: <br>
  Financial Advisors (FA) do not just manage their clients' contacts, they spend a lot of their time meeting clients to clinch deals.
  Thus, it is necessary for them to be able to see the appointment information alongside the client's details (with the need to switch between apps).

  <br>

  * **Highlights**: <br>
  Designed 5 different sub-features(`add appointment`, `edit appointment`, `delete appointment`, `mark appointment` and `unmark appointment`) 
  for user to manipulate the `Appointment`. 
  `add appointment`, `edit appointment` and `delete appointment` was referenced and modified from the existing **AB3** `add`, `edit` and `delete` features.
  <br> <br> `Appointment` and `AppointmentCount` class was designed to allow the `Appointment` feature to function.
  <br> <br> Makes use of parser to check for valid date and time format before formatting them into the desired, more reader-friendly format.

#### Enhancement to Existing Features

* **Enhancements to existing features**:`Multiple Delete` feature.
  * **What it does**:<br>
  The `Multiple Delete` feature allows users to delete up to 10 contacts at one go. 
  It supports 2 input format to cater for different situations the user may be in.
  
  <br>

  * **Justification**: <br>
  This feature allows FAST to be faster for users to manage their contact, as they can delete more contacts with one command.
  
  <br>

  * **Highlights**: <br>
  This is built upon the `delete` feature. The `delete` feature is spilt into 2 portion for handling single and multiple delete as well as to handle the 2 types of input format. 
  Checks for multiple indexes are included and checks for dash(-) symbol is added to capture the information required for multiple delete.
  Implemented duplication detection to prevent user from entering the same indexes.
