### Project: StudyTracker

StudyTracker is a desktop application for users to keep track of their favourite study spots.  
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. This project was built upon
AddressBook - Level 3. It is written in Java, and the team has contributed about 12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
