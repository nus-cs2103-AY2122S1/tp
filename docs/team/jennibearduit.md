### Project: Track2Gather

Track2Gather v1.4 is a desktop application that will manage up to a few thousand contacts, providing basic features for
contact tracing personnel to organise and search through them via personal information, case numbers, and
Stay-Home-Notice periods. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find by case number, phone number, SHN start date and SHN end date,
  in addition to name.
  * What it does: allows users to find by exactly ONE field (either name, case number, phone number, SHN start date,
    or SHN end date) at a time.
  * Justification: this feature allows user to find by a wider range of person fields, instead of just name.
  * The model classes implemented for this feature are `PhoneStartsWithKeywordsPredicate`,
    `CaseNumberEqualsKeywordsPredicate`, `ShnPeriodStartEqualsKeywordsPredicate` and `ShnPeriodEndEqualsKeywordsPredicate`.
  * Additional note: The behaviour of `find` differs based on the field specified by the user. Restrictions on
    user input and more specific usage details can be found in the User Guide.


* **New Feature**: Implemented tests for enforcement mode commands (`session`, `schedule`, `scall`, `fcall`)
  and their parsers.
  * What it does: increase code coverage and allows detection of potential bugs.
  * Justification: as these features are new, tests were written to detect possible bugs.


* **New Feature**: Enhanced Track2Gather to allow addition of optional next-of-kin information (name, address
  and phone number).
  * What it does: allows users to add a person's next-of-kin information, if available.
  * Justification: next-of-kin information serves as a form of emergency contact. It is optional since not everyone
    has a next-of-kin.
