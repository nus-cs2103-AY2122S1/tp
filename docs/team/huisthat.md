### Project: SeniorLove

SeniorLove is a contact management desktop app which aims to facilitate community workers' visits to the elderly. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Senior Love can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add recurring visits for elderly.
    * What it does: Allows the user to add visits that happen regularly at a certain frequency and for a certain number of times.
    * Justification: This feature is significant as the user might want to visit the elderly regularly, which is common in this area related to the elderly, and the user would not have to key in the visit everytime.
    * Highlights: This feature affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future relating to visit for the eldery. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to many of the existing commands.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=huisthat&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Team-based Tasks**:
    * Improve on the view of the GUI to include the last visit and next visit (Pull request [\#61](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/pull/61))

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
