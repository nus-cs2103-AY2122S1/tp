### Project: gitGud

gitGud is a desktop application for managing friends' gaming information. gitGud uses a simple Graphical User Interface
(GUI) combined with an optimized Command Line Interface (CLI) to give you a smooth and efficient experience. If you can
type fast enough, gitGud can get you contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI-based applications.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list friends.
  * What it does: allows the user to list all friends stored in gitGud, with the ability to filter by friend id containing any of the given keywords.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily view all friends they have and apply any filters to easily find specific friends.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list games.
