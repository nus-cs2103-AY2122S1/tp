### Project: InsurancePal

InsurancePal is a client management software specially designed to help manage the logistics of being an insurance agent.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added insurances.
  * What it does: Allows the user keep track of all insurances held by each client in the address book.
  * Justification: It is important for an insurance agent to know what insurance policies each of their clients have. 
  * Highlights: Insurances are classified into three types, Life insurance, Health insurance, and General insurance, 
      and can have a brand name attached to it. 

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=t17&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-09-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=kawaiigabrielneko&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

    ([#188](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/issues/188))
