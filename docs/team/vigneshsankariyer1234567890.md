### Project: Teletubbies

Teletubbies is a desktop application developed and designed for telemarketers and telemarketing supervisors to help manage their customer contacts. 
Teletubbies allow users to create a checklist based on a set of customer contact data, with additional features such as tagging and viewing statistics to help improve their workflow.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to track and move between states of the application. 
(Pull request [\#77](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/77), Pull request [\#173](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/173))
  * What it does: Allows the user to revert to a previous state using `undo` command or a previously undone state using `redo` command
  * Justification: Users are unable to revert to original states if any mistakes were made. This will allow the user to better his/her workflow.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to track the commands previously keyed in by the user. (Pull request [\#69](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/69))
  * What it does: Allows the user to track and store previously input commands using `history` command.
  * Justification: Users are unable to access previously input commands, which may be cumbersome to retype. This will allow the user to easily access previous commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to track the whether the contact has been completed or not with the `done` command. (Pull request [\#37](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/37))
  * What it does: Allows user to track if contact has been contacted before.
  * Justification: Users are not able to track whether they have contacted the person previously, and require more effort to remember.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=vigneshsankariyer1234567890&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

    * Added documentation for key bindings (convenience features).
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `history`, `undo`, `redo` and GUI Bindings for **UP** and **DOWN** buttons.
    * Added implementation details of the `Model` component.
