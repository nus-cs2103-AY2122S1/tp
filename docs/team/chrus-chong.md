### Project: Around the World in $80

Around the World in $80 (AWE) is a desktop application that splits bills between different contacts.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java. Given below are
my contributions to the project.
[RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=chrus&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=false&zFR=false)

### Features
* **New Feature**: Constructed the `creategroup` feature for AWE.
    * What it does: Allows user to create a new travel group with the command line interface.
    * Justification: This feature is crucial as the user should be able to create groups to record travel expenses.
    * Contribution: Built the entire framework for this feature.

* **New Feature**: Constructed the `groupeditname`, `groupaddcontact`, `groupremovecontact`, `groupaddtag` and
`groupremovetag`features for AWE.
    * What it does: Allows user to modify existing group attributes with the command line interface.
    * Justification: This feature is important as the user should be able to modify attributes in travel
  groups after creating them. The prevents the need for deleting a re-creating a group.
    * Contribution: Built the entire framework for this feature.

* **New Feature**: Developed storage functionalities for `creategroup` and `deletegroup` feature.
  * What it does: Allows group data to be saved upon creation or deletion of group.
  * Justification: This feature is crucial as the changes to travel groups should be automatically saved.
  * Highlights: This implementation ensures that the most up-to-date group data is saved into `/data/awe.json` with each
  command.
  * Contribution: Pieced together the basic framework provided by
  [@ramapriyan912001](https://github.com/ramapriyan912001) to develop fully functional storage abilities for
  `creategroup` and `deletegroup`.

### Others
* **Project management**
    * Managed releases: v1.2b

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `create group`, `group add tag`, `group remove tag`, `group add contact`,
         `group remove contact`, and `group edit name`
        * Added details for `About the Document`, `Command Format`, `FAQ`
        * Added `Final Word` section
    * Developer Guide:
        * Created table of contents for ease of navigation.
        * Rearranged all user stories to ensure they follow decreasing order of priority.
        * Added use cases for `Add a Person`, `Clear All Entries` and `Create Travel Group`.
        * Added details for implementation of `creategroup`, `groupeditname` features, including sequence and
          activity diagrams.
        * Added details for manual testing of `creategroup`, `groupeditname`,`group add tag`, `group remove tag`,
      `groupaddcontact`, `groupremovecontact` commands.
        * Added use cases for `addcontact`, `clearalldata`, `creategroup`, `help`, `groupeditname`,
         `groupaddtag`, `group remove tag`, `group add contact`, `group remove contact` commands.
        * Wrote the code for the sequence diagram of `creategroup`, upon which a bulk of the other sequence diagrams
      were based on. Refer to the sequence diagram in the
      [Diagram Contributions to Developer Guide](#diagram-contributions-to-developer-guide) section.

* **Major bug fixes**:
  * **severity.HIGH** `groupremovecontact` does not delete the group even when removing the last member of the group.
  [\#341](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/issues/341)
      * Bug description: The `groupremovecontact` command removes the final person in the group, leaving AWE with a
    group that has no members. (Pull request: [\#360](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/pull/360))

  * **severity.HIGH** `groupeditname` causes AWE to become unresponsive.
    [\#314](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/issues/314)
      * Bug description: The `groupeditname` causes AWE to become unresponsive upon trying to change a specific group
        name to another group name that already exists within AWE. (Pull request:
    [\#360](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/pull/360))
