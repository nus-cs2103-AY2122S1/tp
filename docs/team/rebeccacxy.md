### Project: Fridgy

**Fridgy** is a desktop Food Inventory Manager that makes it easy to reduce food waste by keeping track of what you have and when it expires. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 14 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to manage ingredients in Fridgy
  * What it does: It allows the user to `add`, `delete`, `edit` and `list` ingredients to Fridgy.
    * Justification: With this feature, users will be able to organise their inventory of ingredients. This also sets the foundation for ingredients to be managed by Recipes.
  * Highlights: This feature required amendments to the existing command syntax to allow the respective commands to be associated with ingredient type. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.

* **New Feature**: Added the `quantity` and optional `description` attributes to ingredients.
  * What it does: The `quantity` attribute is essential to the core functionality of both the ingredient and recipe manager. The `description` attribute is a nice-to-have additional field for tracking of ingredients.
  * Highlights: These attributes integrate into other commands that need to specify a quantity and description. They were also integrated throughout the storage-related code so that the quantity and description can be exported to a file.

* **New Feature**: Added automatic sorting of ingredients and their tags
  * What it does: Sorts ingredients by expiry date and name, sorts expiry tags to precede other tags.
    * Justification: A major feature of Fridgy is the ability for the user to know what ingredients are expired or expiring first. The sort functionality enables the user to view ingredients which expire the earliest at the top of the list, indicated by the expired or expiring tag. This feature is also used in the execution of recipes to choose which ingredients to cook when there are multiple ingredients with the same name, i.e. the earliest expiring ingredient is chosen.
  * Highlights: This feature was implemented with minimal changes to existing logic and classes.
