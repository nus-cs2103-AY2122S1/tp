### Project: InsurancePal

InsurancePal is a client management software specially designed
to help manage the logistics of being an insurance agent.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=CheahYan&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=CheahYan&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

**Major Enhancements**
* Implemented `revenue` command ([#80](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/80), [#182](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/182))
  * *What it does*: User can track the revenue gained from each individual contact. User is also able to update 
  and change revenue for individual contacts.
  * *Justification*: Insurance agents have to be able to keep track of the revenue earned from each of his clients
  so as to better manage his resources and to also take note of his own progress.
  * *Classes created*:
    * `Money`
    * `RevenueCommand`
    * `RevenueCommandParser`
    * `Revenue`
  * Tests written:
    * `RevenueCommandTest`
    * `RevenueCommandParserTest`
    * `RevenueTest`

**Minor Enhancement**: Added the ability for month input in `schedule` feature to accomodate for any 3 letter
input (eg. feb, fEB, FEB) ([#110](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/110))
