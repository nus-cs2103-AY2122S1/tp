### Project: SPAM

SPAM is a desktop application that is made for fast-typing marketers to handle large quantities of marketing leads and
contacts efficiently and precisely. It is a CLI application that has UNIX-like command line syntax, and sports an
elegant and modern GUI created with JavaFX. The application is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Batch Import
    * What it does: Imports contacts from _csv_ files. 
    * Justification: To allow ease of transition from most modern marketing software.
    * Highlights: Transfer all your contacts to SPAM in just a couple moments.
    * Credits: [Splitting by Character, Unless in Quotes](https://stackabuse.com/regex-splitting-by-character-unless-in-quotes/) by Scott Robinson.

* **New Feature**: Batch Export
    * What it does: Exports contacts to _csv_ files. 
    * Justification: To add compatibility with most modern marketing software.
    * Highlights: Works in tandem with the select function to generate specified list of contacts to aid in targeted mass marketing.
