### Project: FriendBook

FriendBook is a desktop application for managing your contact details.
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Given below are my contributions to this project.

* **New Feature**: Friend's Description
  * What it does: The feature allows the user to add a description for a friend in FriendBook
  * Justification: Enhances the usability of the app by imporving the user experience
  * Highlights: The changes required thorough understanding of the codebase and OOP and SE principles to ensure a smooth implementation. Especially because this field was optional, I had to pick the most maintainable and extensible solution for an optional field.

* **New Feature**: Friend's Telegram Handle
  * What it does: The feature allows the user to add a friend's telegram handle to FriendBook
  * Justification: Enhances the usability of the app as user can link to other common social apps
  * Highlights: The changes required thorough understanding of the codebase and OOP and SE principles to ensure a smooth implementation.

* **New Feature**: Username command
  * What it does: The feature allows the user set a username for themselves 
  * Justification: Personalizes the app to the user and improves user experience
