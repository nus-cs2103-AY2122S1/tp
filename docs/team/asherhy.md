### Project: ThunderCat

ThunderCat (TC) is a desktop app designed for Year 2 Computing Students. The application acts as an address book for contacts with added support for group projects. You can manage contacts, organise them into project groups and manage your tasks according to those groups.

ThunderCat also acts as a tool for Year 2 Computing Students to build up their confidence in using a Command Line Interface (CLI) to navigate applications and manipulating JSON files - a popular data file format widely used in Computing.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Added Features**
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to `add` a new `Group` to ThunderCat.
    * What it does: allows the user to `add` a new `Group` to ThunderCat specifying its name and description.
    * Justification: A key feature in the application in order access the `Group Information` page and use other core commands related to groups and tasks.
    * Highlights:
        * The `Name` must be present while `Description` is optional.
        * The `Description` optional field was included only after one iteration and adding it was marginally challenging as there were a lot of affected classes to integrate.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to `remove` group members from existing groups while keeping their contact intact inside the ThunderCat.
    * What it does: allows the user to `remove` other contacts from an existing group with existing contact.
    * Justification: A key feature in the application for users to update their group contacts accordingly instead of having to create a new one from scratch everytime there are changes.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to `edit` a `group` details.
    * What it does: allows the user edit the `Name` and the `Description` of the selected group.
    * Justification: As `Description` is set to be optional, this command not only serves its purpose to edit group details but also add `Description` to groups should they choose to leave it empty the first time.
