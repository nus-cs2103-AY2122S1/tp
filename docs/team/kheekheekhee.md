### Project: Around the World in $80

Around the World in $80 is a desktop application that splits bills between different contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 22 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add expenses in groups.
  * What it does: Allows the user to log their expenses within the specified group.
  * Justification: This feature is crucial as the user should be able to log various expenses into respective groups.
  * Highlights: This implementation added in a new command `expense` to add expenses to groups.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to track expenses for everyone in the group to be calculated later on.
  * What it does: Allows users to easily split their expenses.
  * Justification: This feature is crucial as users should be able to easily split their expenses with the use of a command.
  * Highlights: This implementation adds in hashmaps into expenses and groups to track total expenses.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to exclude people from an expense.
  * What it does: Allows users to be excluded from an expense.
  * Justification: This feature is crucial as users should be able to be excluded from an expense if they did not participate in the activity.
  * Highlights: This implementation adds in the ability for the user to exclude individuals from an expense which will result in the expense not being split among excluded members.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to include individual payments in an expense.
  * What it does: Allows users to enter special payments for individuals within an expense.
  * Justification: This feature is crucial as users should be able to enter payments made by an individual which are not meant to be split among the other members of the group.
  * Highlights: This implementation adds individual payments to the specified person only and subtracts it from the total cost so it will not be split among other members.

### Bug Fixes

  * Pull request: [\#179](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/pull/179)

* **severity.HIGH** Entering a large number for `addexpense` results in the app crashing [\#324](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/issues/324)
  * What happened: The value of a large expense was being converted into scientific notation and thus could not saved properly.

* **severity.MED** Error message for `addexpense` is wrong [\#310](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/issues/310)
  * What happened: Entering a group that does not exist shows an error message that the payer is not part of the group rather than indicating that the group does not exist.
