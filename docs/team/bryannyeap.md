### Project: RecruitIn

RecruitIn is a desktop app for recruiters in Singapore to keep track of the plethora of clients with different skill sets, availability and experience.
It is optimized for quick text-based inputs via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the ease of use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
This product will make recruitersâ€™ lives easier through categorisation and filter features to easily access candidates they have in mind.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=bryannyeap)

* **New Feature**: Added the `filter_interview` command and wrote tests for it:
    [\#219](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/219),
    [\#240](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/240)
  * What it does: It gives recruiters the ability to filter applicants depending on whether their interviews have passed, or are still upcoming in the future.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily keep track of and see which applicants have interviews dates that are upcoming or already over, and perform operations them accordingly.
  * Highlights: This feature required some decision-making between design alternatives such as whether to implement it as an enhancement to a current command or a new one, as well as whether to use polymorphism and inheritance.

* **New Feature**: Added the `delete_marked` command and wrote tests for it:
    [\#175](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/175)
  * What it does: It allows recruiters to perform a mass delete on all applicants whose status are `Done`.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it saves a huge amount of time for the recruiters. Recruiters no longer need to search for **and** manually delete applicants whose status are `Done` individually.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Modified `delete` command to allow for deletion of multiple indexes at the same time, and wrote tests for it:
    [\#154](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/154)

  * Added `ExpectedSalary` category, and integrated it for `add`, `edit`, and `find`:
    [\#65](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/65),
    [\#128](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/128)
  * Wrote tests for `ExpectedSalary` category:
    [\#79](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/79),
    [\#88](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/88),
    [\#122](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/122)
    
  * Wrote tests for `Tag` and `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`:
    [\#78](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/78),

  * Disallowed duplicate indexes for `delete`, `mark`, and `unmark` command:
    [#\295](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/295)
    
  * Fixed unintended `mark` and `unmark` command behaviour by instantly detecting out-of-range indexes:
    [\#305](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/305)
    
  * Disallowed incorrect `find` command inputs for the `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Role`, `ExpectedSalary`, and `Tags` category, and wrote tests for it:
    [\#122](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/122)
    
  * Modified `show` command to sort user inputs for `Interview` category in chronological order, and wrote tests for it:
    [\#388](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/pull/388)
