### Project: Notor

Notor aims to help mentors who wish to informally keep tabs on their mentees, by providing a quick way to take notes and
mantain records on their mentees. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is
written in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.

## My Contributions

### **Code contributed**

My code contributed can be found
at [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=HalphasX&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code)

### **New Features**

* [View Pane UI](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/103)
    * The UI now have a split pane, the right side for the list pane (to show the lists of person, group, and subgroup),
      and the left side for the view pane (to view general notes).
    * Justification: The UI for Notor should be able to support ease of access on viewing notes for mentor, and that
      includes the general notes. To be able to view the notes easily, we want to implement a view pane to show the
      notes that mentors have.
    * Modified the main window UI to support viewing pane, so that mentors can easily view the notes they want.

* [Group Card UI and Subgroup Card and List Panels UI](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/143)
    * The UI now will support group and subgroup card templates. In group card, you can check the number of subgroups
      and number of persons. The subgroup card stores the data of the parent group, and the number of person in that
      subgroup. Both groups will have their own notes to describe their groups.
    * Justification: This is to support the group and subgroup so that it can be viewed in the main UI, so that they can
      view the list of groups and subgroups on the list pane.
    * The UI concept is adapted from the person card from AB3.

* [Command for listing persons in a group](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/147)
    * The list command now supports listing people in a particular group. It allows users to view the people in a group
      they organized. We wanted mentors to have an easy access to their mentees without scrolling through the general
      person list, hence we added this feature to support these functionalities.
    * Justification: Mentors should be able to access their mentees easily without having to scroll through each page to
      view their students. By having the command to list people in a group, the mentors can filter out the groups that
      they are not currently interested in, and view the filtered list easier.

### **Enhancements to existing features**:

* [GUI Improvements on Main Window](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/141/commits)
    * The GUI now supports view commands, and can also list out all the groups and subgroups in each group through the
      list and find commands. We improved the color so that it suits Notor's color scheme and increases navigability so
      that you can navigate through the pages easier.
    * Justification: The UI for Notor should be easy to understand to mentors, and each feature's functionalities should
      be clear and concise. Hence, the improvements on the UI are to adhere to this condition.

* [Redesign Person Card UI](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/141/commits)
    * Person Card now supports groups and subgroups functionalities, as well as different color scheme to suit Notor.
    * Justification: The UI for person card should be redesigned to match up Notor's current main window, so that the UI
      does not look out of place and matches the current needs of the mentors.

### **Project management**:

* Handled most of the UI changes and the new UI design.

## **Tools**:

I used IntelliJ and Git Bash for my main source code window and my terminal window, and to create the UI, I used
Scenebuilder.

## **Community**:

As I have less experience with Java and I am still adapting to the workflow, I usually give teammates my suggestion and
tried to help as much as I can on suggestions on certain features. As I was in charge of UI, I also coordinated with my
fellow teammates regarding the commands as well as the supported features. I asked for help on handling CI testing in
the forums (e.g. https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/323
,https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/363)
