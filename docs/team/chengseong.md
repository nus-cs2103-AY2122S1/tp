### Project: ProfBook

ProfBook is an AddressBook Application targeted at CS2103 instructors to manage both students and TAs contacts within teams and tutorial groups. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to import contacts from an existing JSON File
    * What it does: allows the user to merge contacts from another JSON File into the existing AddressBook
    * Justification: This feature can be used in conjunction with the export feature to archive and reinstate contacts and also help instructors facilitate the passing around of contacts

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort the ProfBook
    * What it does: allows the user to sort contacts using the different attributes attached to the contacts, such as their name, Tutorial ID and so forth.
    * Justification: Instructors might want their ProfBook to look more organized and sorting them is the best way to achieve it.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=T16&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-09-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=chengseong&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
