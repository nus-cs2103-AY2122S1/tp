### Overview

BobTheBistroBoss (BTBB) is a desktop application for home chefs to manage their orders and inventory,
optimized for use via a command line interface (CLI).

### Summary of Contributions

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add an ingredient. (Pull request [#69](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/69))
  * **What it does**: Allows the user to add an ingredient to their inventory.
  * **Justification**: Users would want to manage a multitude of ingredients. This feature will allow them to
    add ingredients they wish to track to an inventory, so that BTBB can manage the tracking for them.
  * **Highlights**: The quantity field in an Ingredient can be automatically added or deducted, depending on the amount used in a particular order.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark an order as done or undone. (Pull Request [#93](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/93))
  * **What it does**: Allows the user to mark an order as either done or undone.
  * **Justification**: Users can easily keep track of orders that are incomplete.
  * **Highlights**: Order list will automatically sort completed and uncompleted orders, displaying all uncompleted orders at the top of the list.
  A green checkmark indicates the order is completed and no checkmark indicates the order is incomplete.

* **New Feature**: Added a pie chart to show the user's top 10 most popular recipes. (Pull Request [#134](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/134))
  * **What it does**: BTBB automatically counts the number of times each recipe has been ordered and displays the top 10 recipes
    with the highest number of  in a pie chart.
  * **Justification**: The user can easily see their most popular recipes to gain insight of which dishes to continue selling and which need further development.
  * **Highlights**: JavaFX pie chart together with an observable list was used to implement this feature. The pie chart
    is updated whenever an order has been added, deleted or edited.
