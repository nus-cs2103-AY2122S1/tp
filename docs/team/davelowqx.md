### Project: AddressBook Level 3

Managera is a **desktop app that provides event organisers with a convenient method of keeping track of upcoming events and the details of their participants.**
It does not handle communication between the event organiser and the participants. This project is adapted from SE-EDU AddressBook - Level 3.
