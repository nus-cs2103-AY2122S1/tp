### Project: ComputingConnection

ComputingConnection is for entrepreneurial students in NUS Computing who want
to keep track of other studentsâ€™ skill sets so that they can easily look for
suitable people to work with on future projects.
ComputingConnection is optimized for Command Line Interface (CLI)
over a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for efficiency with a keyboard.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort the contacts in alphabetical order.
    * Main implementation: (Pull request [\#42](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/42))
    * What it does: allows the user to sort the contacts in alphabetical order, case-insensitive.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product as users are able to order their contacts and help them find
      the person they need more efficiently.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects the list of contacts permanently and required careful designing in order to prevent
    it from affecting other features which also manipulated the list of contacts.
    

* **New Feature**: Added the commands for the 'Organisation' class.
    * Main implementation: (Pull request [\#87](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/87))
    * What it does: allows the user to create and delete Organisations, add and remove people from Organisations.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as users are now able to label each of their contact
      to an Organisation. Also, users are able to note down details of the organisations.
    * Highlights: This enhancement is a new class and model carefully designed to prevent it from affecting
      other existing commands. The implementation was slightly challenging as it was a brand-new set of features and had to
      use a combination of various other models and functions to create the new Organisation class.
