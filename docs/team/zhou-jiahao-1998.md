### Project: SPAM

SPAM is a desktop application that is made for fast-typing marketers to handle large quantities of marketing leads and
contacts efficiently and precisely. It is a CLI application that has UNIX-like command line syntax, and sports an
elegant and modern GUI created with JavaFX. The application is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Encryption integration
    * What it does: allows SPAM to read and write from the encrypted file.
    * Justification: This feature makes sure that the data file stays encrypted at all times.
    * Credits: Pair programming with [@huizhuansam](https://github.com/huizhuansam).


* **New Feature**: Password protection
    * What it does: Adds a password to the application.
    * Justification: This feature improves the security of the application data and works hand in hand with the encryption feature.
    * Highlights: One time set up on new data. Able to share the encrypted data file across devices using the same password. The password is not stored anywhere within the application.
