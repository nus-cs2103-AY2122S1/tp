### Project: CSBook
CSBook is a desktop application for Computer Science (CS) Teaching Assistants (TAs) to manage their students. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.
Given below are my contributions to the project:

**Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=greyguy21&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

**New Feature**: Added ability to view a particular student's details

* What it does: allows users to view a student's details such as contact information, assessments etc.
* Justification: this feature enables the user to access all information of the student and allows the user to be able to keep track of the student easily.

  * Adding Group Card and Group List Panel to display groups 
  * Adding Detailed Student Card to view student's information such as contact details and notes

**Team-based tasks**
