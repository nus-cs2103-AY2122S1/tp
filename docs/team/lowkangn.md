### Project: AddressBook Level 3

Managera is a desktop app that provides event organisers with a convenient method of keeping track of upcoming events and the details of their participants and collaborators. It does not handle communication between the event organiser and the participants or collaborators.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `Mark an Event as Done`
    * What it does: Allow users to mark a specific event as done, implying that it has concluded or passed.
    * Justification: After an event has passed, users may want to mark it as done so that they can be certain that the event was conducted and concluded.
