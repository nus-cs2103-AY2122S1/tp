### Project: Sellah

**Sellah** is a desktop application optimized for online sellers who prefer using Command Line Interface (CLI) over
Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It is an address book containing the contact information and orders related to the clients and partners. 
The information and status of each order can also be easily monitored by the user. This product makes it easy 
and convenient to track orders and look for future cooperation.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added List command. (Pull request
  [\#76](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/76))
    * What it does: Allows the user list clients/products in Sellah
    * Justification: Allows user to see the clients/products that they have added into the app.

* **New Feature**: Added Find command. (Pull request
  [\#87](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/87))
    * What it does: Allows the user to find a specific client/product in Sellah.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product because it reduces the time needed for user to find details 
    of a specific client/product from a long list.

    * What it does: A panel to show the list of clients/products, separated by a tab. Tab will automatically change
      between the client tab and product tab based on the command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as it shows the list of client/product in a clear format.
      Tabs are automatically changed to suit users who prefer CLI since clicking will not be needed.
