### Project: ProgrammerError

[ProgrammerError](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp) (PE) is a desktop application which helps CS2100 tutors
manage their studentsâ€™ lab results in a simple and efficient manner, allowing them to spend less time on administrative
processes and more time teaching students.

Given below are my contributions to the project. My contribution to the project code base is also shown in the
[RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17).

### New Features

1. Added to ability to show a student's lab results on the side panel
    * What it does: Allow CS2100 TAs to check a student's lab record on the side panel.
    * Justification: This feature provides a convenient way for CS2100 TAs to view a student's lab record on
      ProgrammerError's UI.
    * Highlights:
        * Developing the ability to use javaFX to design UI by creating a side panel on the MainWindow.
        * Immediate update of student's information and lab results after every command, which requires a modification to
          all existing commands to keep track of the selected student and his/her lab results.
    * Credits: [JavaFX8Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/toc.htm) for guidelines on how to use different
      containers.

2. Added colour-coded tags to each student in ProgrammerError
    * What it does: Green tags represent the marked labs while red ones represent the unmarked labs
    * Justification: This feature allows CS2100 TAs to have a bird view of the marking status of the labs, without a need to
      show student by student.
    * Highlights: Immediate update of tags' color after every command requires a record of the status of the labs similar to
      the show feature.
