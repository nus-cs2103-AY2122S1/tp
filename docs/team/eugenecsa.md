### Project: ContactSh

ContactSH is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ContactSH can get your contact management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
