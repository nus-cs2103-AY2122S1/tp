### Project: ContHACKS

contHACKS is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to manage contacts and lessons. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a lesson ([\#77](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/77)).
    * What it does: Creates the skeletal files needed to create a lesson on the UI.
    * Justification: This feature acts as an extension for the user to store details of their classes as well.
    * Highlights: Uses the Java DayOfWeek library such that indicating the day can be done using a number instead of having to type out the day itself (e.g. 2 for Tuesday, 7 for Sunday). Challenging aspect was to make all the components work together to interact to update the UI from the storage.
    * Credits: Design structure is inspired from AddressBook Level 3, Person package.
