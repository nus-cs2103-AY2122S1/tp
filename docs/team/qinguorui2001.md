### Project: TA<sup>2</sup>

TA<sup>2</sup> is a desktop application designed for teaching assistants from the School of Computing (SoC) at the National University of Singapore (NUS)
to manage student information and keep track of studentsâ€™ assignment submissions.The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
    * What it does: Allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add assignments into the student's assignment list.
    * What it does: Allows the user to add a specific assignment to a student. Newly added assignment will be immediately shown in the assignment list.
    * Justification: This feature ensures the basic function of the product because tutors are responsible for allocating assignments to their students.
    * Highlights: This enhancement provides the basis for other features. (example: `giveall`) The implementation was challenging as it involves the analysis of how it can 
      respond to user input and manipulate the relationships with other classes like `Assignment` class.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete assignments from the student's assignment list.
    * What it does: Allows the user to delete a specific assignment from a student's assignments. Newly deleted assignment will be immediately removed from the assignment list.
    * Justification: This feature ensures the basic function of the product because tutors should be able to delete assignments which they wrongly assigned.
    * Highlights: This enhancement provides the basis for other features. (example: `clean`) The implementation was challenging as it refers to the command pattern of existing commands, and 
      it involves detailed analysis of current backend code to figure the pattern out.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark assignments as completed in the student's assignment list.
  * What it does: Allows the user to mark a specific assignment of a student as completed. Newly marked assignment will be immediately shown as `Completed` in the assignment list.
  * Justification: This feature ensures the basic function of the product because tutors are responsible for marking assignments of their students.
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it involves how the method in `Model` interface can finally change
    the particular `Assignment` instance over a series of internal interactions between each component in `Model`.
