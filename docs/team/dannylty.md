## Project: Game Book

GameBook is a desktop app designed for gamblers to track their gambling games. It is optimized for use via a Command
Line Interface (CLI), but still possesses the benefit of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Our project is a brown-field project. We adapted from the existing 
AddressBook3 ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/tp)) application to build our software.


Below lists my major contributions to the project.

### **Team-based Tasks**
* Set up the organisation group and repository.
* Set up links to code coverage tools and CI.
* Provided an inspiration for the context of the project.
* Participated in reviewing of PRs.

### **Enhancements and Adaptation from AddressBook**
* Handled the commands unit of the software
  * `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `list`, and `exit` commands for initial adaptation in v1.2.
[[#41](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/41)].
  * Refactored `/tag` parameter. [[#98](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/98)]
  * `find` command for adaptation in v1.3. [[#113](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/113)]
* Refactored the macroscopic structure of components. [[#126](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/126)]
  * Enforced separation and abstraction between Model and Logic components.
  * Enforced dependency-inversion principle by making both Parser and Model subclasses depend on
  an abstraction.
  * Enforced further information hiding between interacting components of Parser and Model.
  * A large scale refactoring given that the test suite depended on many of the changed components.
* Continuously managed and updated test suite. [[#66](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/66/files),
[#75](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/75), [#220](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/220)]

### **Documentation**
* **User Guide**
  * Adjusted parameters to `edit` command.
  * Although not included in the PDF, created a sidebar for navigation after much toil through HTML and CSS technology.
  * Participated in review, proofreading, and general editing.
* **Developer Guide**
  * Updated `Logic` component. Adapted sequence diagrams from AddressBook3 to our version.
  * Add use cases
  * Created a sidebar for navigation
  * Participated in review, proofreading, and general editing.
