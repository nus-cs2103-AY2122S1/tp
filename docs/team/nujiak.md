### Project: ProfBook

ProfBook is an AddressBook Application targeted at CS2103 instructors to manage both students and TAs contacts within teams and tutorial groups. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
    * What it does: Allows the user to undo any commands executed, up to the point of the last program start-up.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may make a mistake in executing a command, and the undo/redo command provides a convenient method to reverse any unintended changes.
    * Highlights: This enhancement does not affect existing commands but may affect new commands implementing new data manipulation methods. The implementation was challenging as it was implemented without affecting existing commands.
