### Project: NurseyBook

NurseyBook is a desktop address book application designed to help nurses manage their contacts and tasks. Users primarily interact with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added basic task functionalities.
    * What it does: allows the user to store tasks and execute basic commands on them - i.e. view, add, mark done, delete
    * Highlights: This feature serves as a basis for all future task features. This required careful forethought as the implementation should be flexible enough for future extensions to be made

* **New Feature**: Created separate views for task and elderlies.
  * What it does: allows the user to toggle between viewing task and elderly data
  * Highlights: This feature- especially the creation of the view for tasks, required dabbling in mockups in order to plan how best to display data to users that results in the best user experience

* **New Feature**: Separated elderly's key details from their full details in UI
  * What it does: Display only an elderly's key details in regular view and provides users with a way to view elderly's full details.
  
* **Code contributed**: Around 4kLoC contribution to the project [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=totalCommits%20dsc&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=nicole-luo-exe&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
