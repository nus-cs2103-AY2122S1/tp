### Project: Teletubbies

Teletubbies is a desktop application developed and designed for telemarketers and telemarketing supervisors to help manage their customer contacts. Teletubbies allow users to create a checklist based on a set of customer contact data, with additional features such as tagging and viewing statistics to help improve their workflow.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature** (v1.2): Added the ability to set a profile. (Pull Request [\#42](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/42), Pull Request [\#90](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/90))
  * What it does: allows the user to set a profile for Teletubbies, with the user's name and role (Telemarketer / Supervisor).
  * Justification: This feature enhances the product because the user can now access commands and functionalities that are catered to their roles.

* **New Feature** (v1.3): Added the ability to see the current progress on a pie chart. (Pull Request [\#82](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/82))
  * What it does: allows the user to view the aggregated number of `COMPLETE`, `ONGOING`, and `INCOMPLETE` contacts via a colour-coded JavaFX pie chart.
  * Justification: This feature enhances the product significantly because the user can now handily keep track of their progress, especially for large contact lists.

* **New Feature** (v1.3): Added the ability to see the current role. (Pull Request [\#88](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/pull/88))
  * What it does: allows the user to view their current role on the menu bar.
  * Justification: This feature enhances the product because the user can now refer to their current role, and hence know what are the functionalities currently available to them.
