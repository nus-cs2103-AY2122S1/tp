### Project: WhereTourGo

**WhereTourGo (WTG)** is a desktop app for managing your tour contacts, optimized for use via a Command-Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a `Category` field to allow for categorisation of contacts
  * What it does: Allows users to categorise their contacts according the pre-set six categories. Contacts can be filtered based on category.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to easily differentiate between the types of their contacts.
  * Highlights: This feature required changing other features to support it, such as `add`, `edit`, `filter`.

* **New Feature**: Added input history navigation using arrow keys
  * What it does: Allows users to navigate through previous commands using the up and down arrow keys.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to have access to previous commands, whereby they are able to recall commands and rectify mistakes in older commands. Which fully capitalises on the CLI, increasing their productivity when using the app.
  * Highlights: This features required careful implementation and extensive testing to cover all possible edge cases.

* **New Feature**: Added `cmd` command to provide an easy-to-access command summary.
  * What it does: Opens a command summary in the user's default browser.
  * Justification: This feature allows new users to have a convenient way of learning the commands of the app.
  * Highlights: This feature required careful consideration and scores of research on the best way to implement and show the command summary.
