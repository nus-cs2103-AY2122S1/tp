### Project: AniList

AniList is a desktop Command Line Interface app for managing animes that the user is watching, has watched, and finished watching. AniList is written in Java and the GUI is created with JavaFX.

AniList was created based off AddressBook - Level 3, an address book application used for teaching Software Engineering Principles.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add genres to Animes.
  * What it does: Allows users to tag an anime with various Genres from a set of pre-defined genres.
  * Justification: This feature is essential to our app as it allows for better management of anime. This helped to pave the way for other features such as user statistics and searching based on genre.
  * Highlights: The design of this feature has changed various times so as to provide a better user experience. It was rather challenging trying to come up with solutions that integrated well with other features.
  * Credits: Other team members that assisted with this feature: Chua Min Hong [[github](https://github.com/auhc99)]

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to switch tabs via commands.
  * What it does: Allows users to switch tabs of the anime list via the CLI.
  * Justification: This feature helps to improve the user experience of those who prefer CLI over mouse-click interaction, by removing the need to use a mouse to interact with our GUI.
  * Highlights: The design of this feature is rather different as it required an interaction between the Commands and the UI components, which took us quite a bit of discussion before we could finalize it.

    * Fixed issues with sequence diagrams (PR [\#198](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/198))

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#57](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/57), [\#59](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/59), [\#99](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/99), [\#194](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/pull/194)
  * Reported 11 bugs for other teams during Mock PE.

* **Other Contributions**:
  * AniList was very much a team effort. While we all did have our individual components to make, the team was constantly checking on one another and asking for implementations ideas and correctness. I mainly helped with brainstorming the implementation of various other features, find command in particular, as it was one of the most complicated features that we ended up implementing due to the various behaviours we wanted it to have.
