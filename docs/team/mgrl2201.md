### Project: TuitiONE

TuitiONE is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to `unenroll` a `Student` from a `Lesson`.
  * What it does: allows the user to `unenroll` a `Student` from a specific `Lesson` that the student is currently enrolled in.
  * Justification: A key feature in the application in order to remove the bi-directional linkages between a `Student` and a `Lesson`.
  * Highlights:
    * The `Student` must be currently enrolled in the specified `Lesson`.
    * Abstracting logic for ease of usage within other packages.
    * Ensures that model updates the `Student` and `Lesson` to reflect the removal of the bi-directional linkage.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=mgrl2201&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-09-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases [`v1.2`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.2), [`v1.2b`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.2b)
  * Creating new issues for tasks that need to be completed

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI to fix the display of the context menu upon right-clicking (Pull request [#281](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/281))
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features: `delete`, `delete-l`, `roster` and the respective parser classes to increase coverage to 100% (Pull requests [#198](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/198), [#210](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/210), [#218](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/218), [#219](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/219))
  * Updated UnenrollCommand to take in an index of a lesson instead of a lesson code for the user's ease of use (Pull request [#150](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/150))
  * Added lesson list and relevant methods to the `Model` to enable the establishing of the relationship between `Lesson` objects and the `Model` (Pull request [#64](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/64))
  * Updated the GUI for lesson cards to not show subject, grade and day to declutter the lesson card (Pull request [#202](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/202))
  * Refactored `seedu.addressBook` package to `seedu.tuitione` package and replaced all occurrences of addressbook to tuitione (Pull request [#128](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/128))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Adapted documentation of existing features such as `add`, `delete` in AddressBook3 to match their usage in TuitiONE (Pull request [#22](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/22))
    * Added documentation for the features `unenroll` (Pull request [#22](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/22))
    * Added quick start to UG (Pull request [#129](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/129))
    * Added clarification to feature usage and new questions to FAQ (Pull request [#293](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/293))

  * Developer Guide:
    * Updated use case for `add` and `delete`
    * Added use case for `unenroll` (Pull request [#56](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/56/files))
    * Added implementation of feature `unenroll` (Pull request [#156](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/156/files))
    * Updated sequence diagram for `delete` (Pull request [#157](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/157/files))

* **Tools**:
  * Utilize SceneBuilder to build GUI Layout
