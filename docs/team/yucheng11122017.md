### Project: CONNECTIONS

CONNECTIONS is a desktop address book application adapted from AB3. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about 10 KLOC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to pin and unpin contacts
  * What it does: Allows users to pin and unpin contacts. Pinning contacts will put them at the top of list of contacts, while unpinning contacts will move them behind the pinned contacts.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience significantly because a user can view frequently contacted contacts quickly, reducing the time needed to search for them.
  * Highlights: Dealing with GUI was difficult as pinned contacts have an additional pin but was essentially the same as other contacts. Major changes to the ordering in which contacts were stored were needed as well to allow for pinned contacts to be displayed on top.
