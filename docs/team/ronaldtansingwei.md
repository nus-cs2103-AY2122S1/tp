### Project: FriendBook

FriendBook is a desktop address book application adapted from AddressBook - Level 3.  The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to this project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find users based on their tags.
  * What it does: allows the user to find users with specified tags.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to go through their FriendBook and find friends with related tags more easily, grouping them according to these tags.
  * Highlights: The implementation allows finding of multiple groups at once.
  * Credits: Original design was based off the Find Command previously present inside AddressBook - Level 3
