### Project: SalesNote
  
SalesNote is a desktop application that helps tailors to manage sales and keep track of a smaller, but more recurrent 
group of clients. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, 
and has about 20 kLoC. This project is based on AddressBook - Level 3.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to display client's total orders
  * What it does: displays the total orders for all clients except those without orders in a new window.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might want to know who are the clients that contributed the most to their sales, so that the user can put more effort into engaging those clients.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the UI component, which is usually not the case for other commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. 
  * Credits: I read some Stack Overflow answers to understand the approaches and implemented them myself.

* **New Feature**: Added `Task` and `Order` tabs that allow the user to view lists of different entities (`Task` and `Order`).
