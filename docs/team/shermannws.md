### Project: ProgrammerError

[ProgrammerError](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp) (PE) is a desktop application which helps CS2100 Lab
Teaching Assistants (TAs) manage their studentsâ€™ lab results in a simple and efficient manner, allowing them to spend
less time on administrative processes and more time teaching students. It is optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed with Java and JavaFX.

Please find below my contributions to the project. My contributions to the project code base can also be found at the
following [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=F09-3&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-09-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=shermannws&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false).

#### Features

1. **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter the list of students based on different query parameters.
    * What it does:
      Filters the list of students stored in PE by displaying all the students that matches the query parameters. Tutors
      can specify the filter criteria based on any combination of students' particulars.
    * Justification:
      So that tutors are able to quickly filter out the students' of interest out of their large number of students
      using known parameters (e.g. Class ID).
    * Highlights:
      This feature was challenging as it involved filtering students based on any combination of query parameters
      provided. This also involved creating a whole new command from scratch which requires comprehensive
      understanding of all the classes in PE.

2. **New Feature**: Added a command history feature that allows tutors to navigate to previous commands using up/down
   keys.
    * What it does: Allows tutors to navigate previously executed commands, similar to the Unix CLI.
    * Justification: So that fast-typists tutors are able to be more efficient when using PE.
    * Highlights: This involved a self-directed learning experience using online materials to properly implement an
   "onKeyPressed" event listener. Deep thoughts were also required in the consideration of the edge cases to ensure that this feature is free of bug.
