### Project: ProgrammerError

[ProgrammerError](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp) (PE) is a desktop application which helps CS2100 lab
tutors manage their students’ lab results in a simple and efficient manner, allowing them to spend less time on
administrative processes and more time teaching students. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed with Java and JavaFX.

Please find below my contributions to the project. My contributions to the project code base can also be found at the

#### Contributions

1. **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter the list of students based on different query parameters.
    * What it does:
      Filters the list of students stored in PE by displaying all the students that matches the query parameters. Tutors
      can specify the filter criteria based on any combination of students' particulars.
    * Justification:
      So that tutors are able to quickly filter out the students' of interest out of their large number of students
      using known parameters (e.g. Class ID).
    * Highlights:
      This feature was challenging as it involves filtering students based on any combination of query parameters
      provided. This also involves recreating a whole new command from scratch which requires comprehensive understand
      of all the classes in PE.

2. **New Feature**: Added a command history feature that allows the tutor to navigate to previous commands using up/down
   keys.
    * What it does: Allows tutor to navigate previously executed commands, similar to the Unix CLI.
    * Justification: So that fast-typists tutors are able to be more efficient when using PE.
    * Highlights: Involves a sef-directed learning experience using online materials to properly implement an "
      onKeyPressed" event listener. Requires deep thoughts into the edge cases to ensure that this feature is free of
      bug.

3. **Project management**:
    * Created and set up the GitHub team organisation, repo, pages and actions
    * Managed and ensured the prompt delivery of
      releases [v1.3.trial](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.3.trial)
      & [v1.3.1](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.3.1) (2 releases) on GitHub

4. **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Enhanced the `edit` feature to accommodate the changing requirements of PE (
