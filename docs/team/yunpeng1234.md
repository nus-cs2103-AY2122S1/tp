### Project: Intern Watcher

Intern Watcher (IW) is a desktop app for Human Resource Managers (HRs) to manage internship applicants. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 17 kLoC. Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to do mass deleting of applicants from the displayed list.
    * What it does: Allows the user to delete all applicants from the displayed list, be it from `list` or `filter`.
    * Justification: This feature allows HRs to delete a lot of applicants in one go. eg. Deleting all applicants with `REJECTED` statuses.

* **New Feature**: Added Grade field to applicants.
