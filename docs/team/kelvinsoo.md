### Project: Uni-Fy

Uni-Fy is a desktop app for managing your university workload and it is designed by university students for university students. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a weekly `progress bar` to keep track of all tasks
  * What it does: allows the user to visualise weekly progress
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to keep track of their weekly task completion progress.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future (commands that perform changes to the task). It required an in-depth understanding of `model`, `logic` and `JavaFX` components. The implementation too was challenging as it required updating of the UI using `Observables` and ensuring that all commands that modify/changes tasks also updates the bar.
  * Contribution: Created the `progress bar` UI element and linking it to `model`: [\#191](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/191)

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark a task as `done`.
  * What it does: allows the user to mark a task as done. Also updates the progress bar to show number of task that are done.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to keep track of what tasks they have done and what tasks needs to be done.
  * Highlights: It required an in-depth understanding of `css` for the tag styling/changing of colours.
  * Contribution: Created the state model and linking it to the UI(progress bar): [\#187](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/187)
  
* **New Feature**: Added `priority` property to task.
  * What it does: allows the user to assign priority to their tasks.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to prioritise their tasks.
  * Highlights: It required an in-depth understanding of `css` for the tag styling/changing of colours.
  * Contribution: Created the priority model as well as UI element: [\#209](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/209)

* **New Feature**: Contributed to the `show` feature.
  * What it does: allows the user to show weekly tasks by each day of the week in a weekly panel.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to easily visualise their weekly tasks.
  * Highlights: It required an in-depth understanding of `model`, `logic` and `JavaFX` components. The implementation too was challenging as it required updating of the UI using `Observables` and ensuring that other commands that updates tasks would also update the UI.
  * Contribution: Created the initial framework for the feature. Linking the `logic` and `model` of show with the `UI`: [\#128](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/128), [\#168](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/168)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Improve find feature to allow more predicates and find base on date, tag. [\#169](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/169)
