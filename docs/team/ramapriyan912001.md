### Project: Around the World in $80

Around the World in $80 is a desktop application that allows group travellers to split bills between different contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 22 kLoC.

My contributions to the project can be viewed [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ramapriyan&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=false&zFR=false).

### Features
* **New Feature**: Contributed to delete group feature
    * What it does: Allows the user to delete a group with a command.
    * Justification: This feature is crucial as the user should be able to delete groups once they are obsolete or if the user has made an error.
    * Highlights: This implementation added in a new command `deletegroup` to delete a group by name.
    * Contribution: Built the entire framework for the feature including command and parser classes.

* **New Feature**: Contributed to create group feature.
  * What it does: Allows the user to create a group with select members with a command.
  * Justification: This feature is crucial as the user should be able to create groups with select members based on their travels.
  * Highlights: This implementation added in a new command `creategroup` to create a group with select members.
  * Contribution: Adapted command format and parser. Contributed significantly to the logic for storage of groups.

* **New Feature**: Contributed to delete expense feature.
    * What it does: Allows the user to delete an expense with a command.
    * Justification: This feature is crucial as the user should be able to delete errant expense entries.
    * Highlights: This implementation added in a new command `deleteexpense` to delete an expense by index position on list shown on screen.
    * Contribution: Built the entire framework for the feature including command and parser classes.

* **New Feature**: Contributed to calculate payments feature.
    * What it does: Provides the users with a set of easy transactions for them to settle their debts from the trip.
    * Justification: This feature is crucial as the users should be able to efficiently settle their debts in a manner that leaves no room for disputes and no room for error by manual computation.
    * Highlights: This implementation added in a new command `calculatepayments` to provide users with a number of suggested transactions to settle their debts from the trip.
    * Contribution: Built the entire framework for the feature including command and parser classes.
  
* **Miscellaneous**:
    * Introduced constraints to `editcontact` and `deletecontact` commands wherein user must be viewing a contacts page if they wish to execute these commands.
    * Introduced constraints to the `deleteexpense` command wherein user must be viewing an expenses page if they wish to execute this command.
    * Implemented classes for UI display of payments upon execution of `calculatepayments` command.


### Testing

  * `DeleteGroupCommand`
  * `DeleteGroupCommandParser`
