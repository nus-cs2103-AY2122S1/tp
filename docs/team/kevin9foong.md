### Project: gitGud

[gitGud](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/) is a typing-focused desktop application for managing friends' gaming information. 
It is dedicated to busy gamers and aims to solve their key problem by helping them find available and highest skilled 
friends to win competitive games with. <br>

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* Code contributed: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=kevin9foong&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-09-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false)
* New Features
  1. Add Friend and Game functionality ([PR #69](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/69)) <br>
     **What it does**: Allows users to add friends and games to the gitGud friends and games list respectively.<br>
     **Justification**: Core functionality for users to store lists of friends and games.
  2. Edit Friend functionality ([PR #93](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/93)) <br>
     **What it does**: Allows users to edit friend's name.<br>
     **Justification**: Allows user to update friend's name without having to re-create friend and having to re-provide same information.
  3. Implemented Storage support for Friends and Games ([PR #69](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/69)) <br>
     **What it does**: Allows friends and games data to be stored across multiple application runs by storing data in JSON files on the hard drive. <br>
     **Justification**: Allows users to store gaming information permanently without having to re-enter each time gitGud is used.<br>
  4. Add friend skill functionality ([PR #102](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/102)) <br>
     **What it does**: Allows user to store and update friends' skill at different games.<br>
     **Justification**: Core functionality for users to keep track of and remember the most-highly skilled friends to play with.
  5. Friend recommendation functionality ([PR #153](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/153)) <br>
     **What it does**: Recommends friends for user to play with for a given game and given time based on highest skill value of friend.<br>
     **Justification**: Core functionality which helps users find optimal friends to play with that both fits into their busy schedules and 
     is the most skilled.

* Testing 
  1. Wrote unit/integration tests (>=98% lines and 100% method coverage) for Storage component and the features I added above 
  (including e.g. integration tests which ensures recommend works with list command in succession)
  2. Manual testing and reporting of bugs in application, UG and DG. ([Issues raised and resolved](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Akevin9foong+is%3Aclosed))
  3. Discovered and fixed testing bugs (e.g. schedule tests which use shared mutable references)

* Contribution to team based tasks
  1. Project-wide refactoring of codebase to adapt AB3 to gitGud's needs ([PR #45](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/45)).
  2. Integrated the GitHub plugin (codecov) to the team repo.
  3. Set up initial project website, team repo & organization.
     
* Documentation
  * User Guide (UG) ([PR #209](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/209), [PR #133](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/133) and [PR #35](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/pull/35)):
    1. Added documentation for `edit`, `add friend skill` and `recommend` features.
    2. Overhauled UG to make it more conversational and directed to target user. 
    3. Added icons/symbols, command constraints and warnings to each user command. 
    4. Added user guide structure, glossary, application UI overview and FAQ sections.
  * Developer Guide (DG):
    1. Added value proposition and use case for `add friend`.
    2. Highlighting of bugs (e.g. use case bugs ([Issue #243](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/issues/243)) and UML diagram bugs ([Issue #251](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/issues/251)))
    3. Added documentation for Storage component (including UML class diagram) and `recommend` command implementation (including UML activity and sequence diagrams).
  * README:
    1. Updated GitHub Actions build status and codecov badges.
