### Project: GameBook

GameBook is a desktop app designed for you to track your gambling performance and view instant analysis of
your gambling records.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Modifications to existing features**:<br>
  * Refactoring `Storage` component of AB3<br>
  * Adding Tests for GameBook's `Storage` Class.
  
* **Enhancements to existing features**:<br> 
  * Bug fixes in existing features 
  
* **New Features**:<br>
    * Implementing Graphical Analysis of game entries:<br>
        * Used JavaFX LineChart to plot the average profit across dates on the GraphPanel and integrate them into the GUI.
          The graph feature provides users with a visualisation of their average profits 
          across the last 20 dates. This supports our user story of being able to view analysis of their game statistics
          and evaluate their performance while doing so.  
        * By implementing this feature, I gained a better understanding about using JavaFX LineChart and how it can be used to 
          visualise data efficiently using various data structures to process this data. It also provided me with an opportunity to understand the different UI components and their interactions 
          through JavaFX better. 
     
    * Implementing Statistical Analysis of game entries:<br>
        * Implemented the classes which calculate the Mean and Median and integrate them into the GUI
        The calculation of mean and median of the overall profits of the users provides users with analysis of their 
        overall average profits. The statistics are re-calculated and updated after every command and displayed on the GUI.
        This supports our user story of being able to view game statistics to evaluate their performance.<br> 
        * By implementing this feature, I gained a better understanding into the internal workings of the app to facilitate the efficient 
        calculation of the statistics. Implementing this feature also supplemented my understanding of the Graphical Analysis 
        feature which helped in further improving the Graphical Analysis feature.
    
* **Documentation**:<br>
  * Developer Guide: 
    * Wrote the design section and added the class diagram for `Storage`
    * Wrote the implementation section and added the sequence diagram for the Graph and Statistics feature
    * Wrote the implementation, Use Cases and instructions for manual testing sections for the `find` Command 
    * Miscellaneous minor edits while reviewing the DG
