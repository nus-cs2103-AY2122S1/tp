### Project: LingoGO!

LingoGO! is a **desktop app** for **university students who use English as their first language** and are trying to **learn a
new language**. Our unique **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and elegant **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** is sure to delight you, and empower you on your journey in mastering the new language you *have always wanted*.

* **<u>Enhancements/Features Implemented</u>**
  1. **Enhanced help window**
    * PR(s): [\#39](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/39), [\#148](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/148)
    * Created dropdowns to display information for each command.
    * This gives users more accessibility to help if they just need a quick reminder on how a specific command is used, instead of requiring them to go to the user guide (although that option is still available for them).
    * This also allows our app to be more user friendly when functioning without an internet connection.
  1. **Refactoring of UI component of AB3 for LingoGO!**
    * PR(s): [\#69](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/69), [\#73](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/73), [\#106](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/106)
    * Refactored the UI component to let the app display flashcards.
    * Created the app logo.
  1. **Slideshow feature**
    * PR(s): [\#106](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/106), [\#109](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/109)
    * Implemented the frontend for the slideshow feature to receive updates from Model and Logic so that the correct information is displayed to users.
    * This feature allows users to test their memory of their flashcards. The app displays flashcards to them one at a time, and they can key in an answer for each flashcard. The app then tells them whether they remember correctly or incorrectly.
  1. **Fixing up of UI bugs**
    * PR(s): [\#59](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/59), [\#196](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/196), [\#222](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/222), [\#223](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/223)
    * Fixed font issues on macOS for help window.
    * Fixed text display issues.
    * Fixed issue where alert windows would cause the app to crash for some macOS users.
