### Project: TutAssistor

TutAssistor is a desktop application for private tutors to manage tuition class timeslots. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Enhancements implemented
* **Create edit features**: Designed and created `EditCommand`, `EditClassCommand`, `EditClassDescriptor` and its corresponding `Parser` classes. (Pull request [\#125](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/125))
  * What it does: Allows user to edit any details of a student or tuition class with the exception of remarks in **TutAssistor**
  * Justification:  This makes the user experience much more pleasant as now they do not have to delete and recreate students or classes in order to change a few details.
  
* **Create delete features**: Designed and created `DeleteCommand`, `DeleteClassCommand` and its corresponding `Parser` classes. (Pull requests [\#46](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/46))
  * What it does: Allows user to delete a student or tuition classes in **TutAssistor**
  * Justification:  This enables the user to remove entire records pertaining to a student or a tuition class entire students or classes in order to change a few details.
  * Highlights:
    * Duplicate indexes in user inputs have to be removed to ensure that only one student/class is deleted at a particular index.
    * The order of deletion has to be considered carefully by sorting the indices before deletion, as the 
list of students/classes changes while students/classes are being deleted respectively.
  
* **Implement `RemoveStudent` feature**: Designed and created `RemoveStudentCommand`, `RemoveStudentCommandParser`. (Pull request [\#58](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/58))
  * What it does: Allows user to remove an existing student from a tuition class in **TutAssistor**
  * Justification:  This is more convenient for the user as now they do not have to delete and recreate a tuition class when a student drops out of a class.
  * Highlights: 
    * Efforts are taken to ensure that students who are not enrolled in the class are not removed and this is conveyed to the user.
  
* **Refactor Timeslot class**: Refactor Timeslot class to use Java `LocalTime` and `Date` for class timings instead of`String`. (Pull request [\#125](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/125))
  * What it does: Parses and saves the timing of any tuition class as `Date` and `LocalTime` to compare timeslots across classes. 
  * Justification: Previously, the time slot was a `String` which created parsing errors causing classes to be created at invalid timings. Multiple classes
were also scheduled simultaneously due to these errors. Following the refactoring of the `Timeslot`, classes were created only at valid times and the timetable conflicts were detected more easily 
using the existing Java API.
  * Highlights:
    * This is a major refactor as the `Timeslot` is crucial for the logic of `Timetable` and general management of all the tuition classes. 

* **Refactor some commands to use multiple indexes**: Refactor `DeleteCommand`, `DeleteClassCommand` and `RemoveStudentCommand` to use multiple student or class indexes as arguments. (Pull request [\#65](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/65))
  * What it does: Allows user to delete multiple students or tuition classes as well as remove multiple students from a class.
  * Justification: Improve efficiency so that the user is able to remove multiple students or classes using one command instead of 
repeating similar commands multiple times.

* **Testing**: Create tests for the `EditClassCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, `DeleteClassCommandParser` and `RemoveStudentCommandParser` as well as their related classes to increase coverage. (Pull Request [\#216](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/216))

#### Contributions to the User Guide
* Added to the FAQ and Introduction, formatted figures and enabled quicklinks for the command summary.(Pull Request [\#139](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/139))
* Added implementation details for `EditClassCommand`, `EditCommand`, `DeleteClassCommand` (Pull Request [\#217](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/217))
* Fix some documentation bugs from PE-D (Pull Request [\#187](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/187))
* Added screenshots for the `DeleteCommand` (Pull Request [\#217](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/217))

#### Contributions to the Developer Guide
* Added the implementation details of `EditClassCommand` (Pull Request [\#135](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/135))
* Added UML diagrams for `RemoveStudent` , `DeleteClassCommand` features (Pull Request [\#209](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/209))
* Added implementation details of `EditCommand`, `DeleteCommand` (Pull Request [\#217](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/217))
* Added use cases for TutAssistor
