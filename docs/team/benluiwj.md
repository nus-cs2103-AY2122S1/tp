### Project: Sellah

**Sellah** is a desktop application optimized for online sellers who prefer CLI over GUI. It is an address book that
contains the contact information and order details related to clients and partners. The user interacts with it using a
CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added Stat feature (Pull request 
[\#143](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/143),
[\#153](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/153),
[\#204](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/204),
[\#212](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/212)
)
  * What it does: Allows user to view statistics of current inventory, initially based on profits, now based on stock
  * Justification: Provides the user with a clearer picture of their profits (initially) to better understand how 
    his business is currently doing.
* **New Feature**: Added View feature (Pull request
[\#72](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/72),

[\#212](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/212)
)
  * What it does: Allows users to view the details of a client or product in detail
  * Justification: Primary panel only displays the name with price (for product) and phone number (for client). The 
    user may want to see more information such as Orders and Address of the client.
