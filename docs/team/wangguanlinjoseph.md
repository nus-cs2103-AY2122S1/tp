### Project: TAB

TAB is a desktop address book application that can help Teaching Assistants (TAs) manage their students'
progress.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
