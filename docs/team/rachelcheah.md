### Project: ProfBook

ProfBook is an AddressBook Application targeted at CS2103 instructors to manage both students and TAs contacts within teams and tutorial groups. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added an Export command 
  * What it does: Allows users to export the last searched list of contacts to a json file
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to export the list of contacts to a json file to share the contacts file with another ProfBook User to be imported or for reference/other use outside of ProfBook.
  
* **New Feature**: Added an Export Email command
  * What it does: Allows users to export the emails of the last searched list of contacts to a file
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to export a list of emails of the last searched contacts to a file so that they can create a group in Outlook to mass send emails to a particular group of students.
  
* **New Feature**: Added a Stat(istics) command
  * What it does: Allows users to see the count of tags, student and tutorial ID 
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to summarise the last search list in terms of the count of tags, student and tutorial ID. This has many uses, such as allows the user to get a count of how many students and TA are in a particular tutorial group or if there are a particularly large number of problematic students from a particular tutorial group.
