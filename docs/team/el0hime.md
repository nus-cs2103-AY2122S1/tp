### Project: NUS Mod Tracker

NUS Mod Tracker is a desktop application designed for NUS Computer Science (CS) students who are enrolled in the Academic Year 2021/2022 and onward to create their own academic plan,
as well as to keep track of their Modular Credits(MC) and modules taken. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find modules in NUS Mod Tracker.
    * What it does: Allows the user to find modules based on the keywords they inputted.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can search for modules to add to their academic plan and also the user can check if their desired module is in the database or not.
    * Highlights: This enhancement requires constant updating and changing. This is because we constantly upgraded the information inside a module and as such, we had to increase the number of parameters a user can search for modules. Hence, enhancements as well as test cases were constantly added for this feature.
