### Project: Socius

**Socius** is a desktop application that can help CS2103T Software Engineering students to manage classmatesâ€™ contacts, make friends and find teammates!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to add remark to a person.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add a remark to a person by index.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing the user to customise messages for his or her contacts based on his or her impression of the person.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future as it introduces new parameter to the `Person` class.
  * Credits: The `Remark` model was taught in Week 6 on the CS2103T website [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp/tutorials/AddRemark.html).

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to delete multiple contacts.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete all contacts with matching keywords.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user may want to delete multiple contacts and the app should provide a convenient way to do it with one command.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of the design alternatives.

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to sort contacts.
  * What it does: Allows the user to sort all contacts based on a specified field.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because a user may want to sort his or her contacts and the app should provide a convenient way to do so.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of the design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required additional `Comparator` classes for every field.

* **New Enhancement:** Added `Nationality` model to a `Person` class.
  * What it does: Allows a person's contact to contain nationality defined by the user.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product by offering more personal details of a classmate which will aid user in forming project group that meet the nationality ratio requirements.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future as it introduces new parameter to the `Person` class.

* **New Enhancement:** Added command history which allows for the ability to navigate between all previously entered commands.
  * What it does: Allows users to reuse previously entered commands using the up and down arrow keys.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it increases efficiency and convenience for any user who may want to revisit their commands.
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it required an in-depth analysis of the `JavaFX` and `Ui`.
