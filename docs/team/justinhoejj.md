### Project: CONNECTIONS

CONNECTIONS is a desktop app adapted from [AddressBook - Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) for managing contacts and keeping track of birthdays.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java and has about 10 KLOC. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a Birthday Reminder List
    * The list displays contacts sorted by birthdays in ascending order, starting with the
      nearest upcoming birthday all the way through the latest birthday and then looping back
      to the earliest birthday.
    * The list is responsive to changes in contact details be it using add, delete or edit command. The list
      reorders contacts where appropriate to ensure it stays sorted as described above.
    * Birthday at present day and upcoming birthdays within 7 days are color coded and provided with personalised message.
    * This feature would allow our target user, a person who loves birthday celebrations, always wish contacts on
    their birthday.
    * Account for birthdays that fall on leap days by ensuring they are brought forward to 28th Feb on non leap years.

* **New Feature**: Added Delete Multiple Command
    * Delete Multiple Command allows the user to delete multiple contacts with a single command by providing
      a start and end index.
    * This feature will allow our target user to delete contacts of the same group. Groups are usually identifiable
      with find by tags, upon filtering contacts of the same group the user can selectively delete those contacts.
