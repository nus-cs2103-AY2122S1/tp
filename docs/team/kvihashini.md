My name is Keerthi Vihashini and I am one of the developers of Tutor Master.

TutorMaster is a desktop app for freelance tutors to manage their studentsâ€™ details and related tasks. It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still benefiting from a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.
