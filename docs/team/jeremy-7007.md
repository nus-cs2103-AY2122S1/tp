My name is Le Quoc Huy, and I am part of the development team for Tutor Master

### Project: Tutor Master

TutorMaster is a desktop app for freelance tutors to manage their studentsâ€™ details and related tasks. It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still benefiting from a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
