### Project: SeniorLove

SeniorLove is a contact management desktop app which aims to facilitate community workers' visits to the elderly. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Senior Love can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add last visits for elderly.
    * What it does: Allows the user add the elderly's last visit with the add command.
    * Justification: This feature is core to the functionality of SeniorLove, enabling the user to track the last time they visited any elderly.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to display summary statistics.
    * What it does: Displays the statistics of overdue visits, recent last visits and upcoming visits.
    * Justification: This feature gives a brief overview of their recent and incoming work, and helps users to keep track of their visitation KPIs.
    * Highlights: This enhancement required the incorporation of new GUI and careful handling of its integration with the command logic.
