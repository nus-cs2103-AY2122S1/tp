### Project: Pocket Hotel

**Pocket Hotel (PH)** is a desktop app for hotel front-desk receptionists that provides a centralized location to manage their guests and vendors, and helps to automate front-desk operations.

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **New Feature**: chargeguest, add ability to charge guest with a service. [#168](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/pull/168) [#183](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/pull/183)
  * What it does: Allows the user to charge a guest with a service provided by a vendor. Able to store
multiple chargeable as well.
  * Justification: Since we have a feature to export the total bill in pdf as an invoice to the guest,
this command compliments it and is required for the workflow to proceed smoothly.


* **Modified Feature**: clearguest,  would clear all guest contacts [#296](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/pull/296)
  * What it does: Removes all guest from the `guest.json` file.
  * Justification: Should have a way to separately remove all guest without checking out.


* **Modified Feature**: clearvendor, would clear all vendor contacts [#296](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/pull/296)
  * What it does: Removes all vendors from the `vendor.json` file.
  * Justification: Should have a way to separately remove all vendors.


* **Enhance Implementation**: Modified AB3 Json files to better suit our needs for Pocket Hotel [#83](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/pull/83) [#86](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/pull/86) [#88](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/pull/88) [#98](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/pull/98)
  * What it does: Now we have 3 Json files, `guest.json`, `vendors.json` & `archive.json` with their respective
format and validations. 
  * Justification: This is to ensure easier management and clear distinction between the json files.
