### Project: CliTutors

`CliTutors` is a desktop app for **managing private tutoring jobs**, optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a private tuition agency with a **big list of tutors to manage**, `CliTutors` can help you to manage matching tutors and students for private tuition faster than using a regular database.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a `match` command (Pull requests [\#68](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/68))
  * What it does: allows the user to match students to tutors
  * Justification: This feature is one of the core features of `CLITutors` as one of the use cases of this product is to match students to tutors who teach the subject that the students want to learn
  * Highlights: I had to come up with different ways to match students to tutors and decide the most optimal way to do it. Students have multiple tags as well and I had to account for it when matching, making implementation of this feature more challenging.

* **New Feature**: Added sorting functionality to match tutor list after a `match` command. (Pull requests [\#120](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/120))
  * What it does: Sorts the matched tutor list based on the number of matching tags with students after matching a student to tutor.
  * Justification: This feature allows tutors who have more matching tags with students to be displayed first, which provides students with the convenience to view the tutor that is more suited for them first.
  * Highlights: Implementation of this feature was very challenging due to `FilteredList` being an unmodifiable list. It took me some time to find a workaround as I had to study the code base more carefully to find out where I was able to modify the list.
