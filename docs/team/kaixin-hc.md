### Project: Notor

Notor aims to help mentors who wish to informally keep tabs on their mentees, by providing a quick way to take notes and
mantain records on their mentees. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is
written in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.

Given below is a summary of my contributions to the project. You can find the code contributed at the following link: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=kaixin-hc&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&search=AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-09-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

### Project management

  * Managed Project Releases 1.1-1.4 (6 milestones & releases)
    * Ensured deliverables were submitted on time
    * Assigned issues to milestones and closed them when completed
  * Managed the issue tracker throughout the project.
    * Closed finished issues, created issues, labelled issues and connected them to PRs
  * Took minutes for team-meetings

### Enhancements to existing features

* Find Person Command: ([#140](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/140)).
  * Enhanced the Find command so that it could search via tags or via name of the person, as well as search for partial strings.
  * This is useful because the user no longer needs to remember the exact name, and can use tags to further filter the list of persons
* Tag Command: ([#133](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/133), [#121](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/121))
  * Amended the tag command so that tags are added cumulatively, rather than deleting all tags and redoing them every time
  * In Notor, this takes the form of the Tag command, the Untag Command, and the Clear Tags command
* Refactored AB3 to Notor throughout the project ([#93](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/93))
  * While not visible to the user, this helped to clean up our code base for all of us.
* Error messages in Notor & minor bugs([249](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/249))
