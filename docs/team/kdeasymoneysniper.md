### Project: ComputingConnection

ComputingConnection is for entrepreneurial students in NUS Computing who want 
to keep track of other studentsâ€™ skill sets so that they can easily look for 
suitable people to work with on future projects. 
ComputingConnection is optimized for Command Line Interface (CLI) 
over a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for efficiency with a keyboard.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to get a detailed view for a contact.
  * Main implementation: (Pull request [\#79](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/79))
  * What it does: allows the user to view the details of a specified contact, including remarks and interactions.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view important details about a 
    contact that they would not be able to otherwise, and creates a more appealing GUI for the user, instead of 
    cramming all details into the original space.
  * Highlights: This enhancement is a new command by itself and required careful designing in order to prevent it from
    affecting preexisting features. The implementation too was challenging as it required usage of JavaFx and the
    blending of various other models in order for accurate frontend display on the GUI.

* **New Feature**: Added the 'Remark' field to the 'Person' model.
  * Main implementation: (Pull request [\#72](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/72))
  * What it does: allows the user to store remarks regarding a particular contact.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because this field would allow users to leave misc
    comments about a particular contact that they would want to remember in the future, allowing for an infinitely wide
    array of usage, as this field is truly miscellaneous, and up to the user to decide how to use it.
  * Highlights: This enhancement is a new field/model that is implemented within an existing 'Person' model and 
    required careful designing in order to prevent it from affecting preexisting features.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Edited the 'Find' command to allow for partial matches. (Pull request 
    [\#40](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/40))
  * Made the app full screen by default. (Pull request
    [\#179](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/179))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the feature `view` [\#90](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/pull/90)
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `find`:
