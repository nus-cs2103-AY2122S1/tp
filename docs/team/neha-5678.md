My name is Srinivasan Neharikha and I am one of the developers of TutorMaster.

### Project: Tutor Master

TutorMaster is a desktop app for freelance tutors to manage their studentsâ€™ details and related tasks.
It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still benefiting from a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Code contributed**: [RepoSense](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-09-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Neha-5678&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Enhancements Implemented**:
  * Logic
    * Created parsers and commands for edit task feature [\#94](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/issues/94)
    * Created parsers and commands for find task feature [\#116](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/issues/116)
    * Created list task feature [\#131](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/issues/131)
    * Edited delete group feature to delete the group ids from the respective persons [\#134](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/issues/134)
  * Model
    * Added Model for Tasks [\#54](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/issues/54)
  * Storage
    * Added storage for Tasks [\#72](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/issues/72)
    * Added storage for Groups [\#134](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/issues/134)
    * Difficulty faced: It was difficult to save the Unique Id objects of each Task or Group in the Json file as 
      the Json file only supports some types. Hence, I had to convert it to a string to save it in the Json file. When 
      parsing the Json files, I had to convert the string to a UniqueId object again which involved additional 
      constructors.
  * Included more sample data for the various aspects of our project (e.g. Students, Tasks, Groups etc.) so that they appear 
    when the jar file is first launched. This aims to make the application more user-friendly. [\#214](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/pull/214)

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `Editing a task`, `Listing all tasks` and `Finding a task by name` [\#140](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/pull/140/files), [\#20](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/issues/20)
