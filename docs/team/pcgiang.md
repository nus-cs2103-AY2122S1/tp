### Project: SoConnect

SoConnect is a **desktop app for SoC students to manage contacts of Professors and Teaching Assistants,
as well as to keep track of noteworthy events, optimized for use via a _Command Line Interface (CLI)_** while still having
the benefits of a _Graphical User Interface (GUI)_. 

This project is part of the [CS2103T](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/) team project requirements for AY2021/2022 Semester 1.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Worked together with Chun Wei to add the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
    * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation was challenging as it requires an in-depth analysis of how commands interact and are displayed in order to come up with the most suited implementation.


* **New Feature**: Enabled fields to be copied.
  * What it does: allows user to copy important information or open any links simply by clicking on a field label.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently get important information and use it elsewhere without having to manually copy the fields.
  * Highlights: This enhancement requires understanding of GUI framework.


* **New Feature**: Added a feature that allow colourful tags for contacts and events.
    * What it does: displays different tag names with different colours such that the user can easily identify the different tags names.
    * Justification: This feature improves the UI of the product significantly and aids the user in differentiating the different tags.
    * Highlights: This enhancement requires understanding of GUI framework.
