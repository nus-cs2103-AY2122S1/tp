### Project: ePoch

ePoch is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It has been designed for the busy NUS student, allowing the user to create contacts for persons and to create CCAs, link those persons and CCAs together, and to create periodic reminders for those CCAs.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
