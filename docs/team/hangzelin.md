### Project: MyCRM

MyCRM is a desktop application for managing client contacts, repair job statuses, and product information that has been optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while maintaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type quickly, MyCRM can complete customer relationship management tasks faster than traditional GUI applications.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

  * **Enhancements to existing features**: Modified old contacts in **AddressBook** to `addContact`, `editContact`, `findContact`, `deleteContact` and `listContact` commands.
      * What it does: Allows users to make basic operations in **contact** part of **MyCRM**.
      * Justification: These add, edit, find etc. commands are now viewed as only a part of commands in **MyCRM** system,
      and served as commands specific towards **contact** part in **MyCRM**. Besides, a contact is no longer viewed as normal
      friends in addressBook, but a cooperation partner, so information given should be working official.  
      * Credits: These modifications follow the design pattern in **AddressBook**.
  * **Enhancements to existing features**: Enhanced `addContact` command to support **optional** fields.
      * What it does: Allows users to enter partial information of a client.
      * Justification: A client may consider his own privacy issue, thus **MyCRM** should allow a client to conceal 
      part of his/her information.
  * **Enhancements to existing features**: Enhanced `listContact` command to be able to list **unhidden** or **all** contacts in the list.
      * Justification: Since there are hidden clients in the list, normal `listContact` only support viewing unhidden
      contacts in the list. Therefore, a different **listContact** command is needed if a user requires to see all contacts
      in the list.
  * **Enhancements to existing features**:  Enhanced `deleteContact` command to disable deletion of a contact if it is already linked to a job.
      * Justification: It is not reasonable if a user requires to delete a client in **MyCRM** when the job
      linked to this client has not been completed yet.
  <br><br>
  * **New Features**: Added `hideContact` and `undoHideContact` command to Contact part of **MyCRM**:
      * What it does: Allows users to hide unused contacts in MyCRM. Users can type `undoHideContact` to set this client back 
      to **not hidden** state. A hidden contact will have a new tag **hidden**, indicating that this client is currently unused,
      and not visible in the normal contact list.
      * Justification: This feature improves the MyCRM's efficiency when accessing clients 
      because a user can prevent himself/herself getting distracted by unused clients.
      They can also set hidden clients back to visible easily with these two commands.
      * Highlights: This enhancement affect the visibility of contact list. It requires further changes in
      other contact commands if users want to view this contact or make operations upon it.
  * **New Features**: Added `findJob` command to Job part.
      * What it does: Allows users to find certain jobs via a job's description, client name, 
      product name linked to it or completion status.
      * Justification: This feature improves the MyCRM's efficiency when accessing jobs. Users can easily locate
      jobs they hope to seek in the list.
      * Credits: This new feature follows the design pattern of **AddressBook**'s `find` command, and more keyword types
      are allowed in `findJob` instead of only the name of a job.

  * **Enhancements in Tests**:
    * Wrote more test cases for existing features: `addContactCommandParser`, `deleteContactCommand`,
    `ListContactCommand`, `listContactCommandParser`, and increases code coverage from 54% to 59%
