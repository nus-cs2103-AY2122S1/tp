### Project: gitGud

gitGud is a desktop application for managing friends' gaming information. gitGud uses a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) combined with an optimized Command Line Interface (CLI) to give you a smooth and efficient experience. If you can type fast enough, gitGud can get you contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI-based applications.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  1. Added the ability to link a friend with a game he/she plays.
     1. What it does: allows the user to associate a friend in his contact list with a game that was previously recorded.
     2. Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to note down what games his/her friends play.
