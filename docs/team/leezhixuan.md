### Project: CONNECTIONS

CONNECTIONS is a desktop app adapted from [AddressBook - Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) for managing contacts and keeping track of birthdays.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java and has about 10 KLOC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: FindAny
  * What it does:
    * FindAny is a command that allows users to apply an 'OR' filter with the search terms they have provided.
  * Justification:
    * "OR" search retrieves records that include either terms searched for. Using OR broadens a search and thus returns more results.
      This way, users will be able to filter contacts with greater flexibility.
      <br>
* **New Attribute**: Birthday
  * What it does:
    * The birthday attribute records the date of birth of a contact.
  * Justification:
    * Our target audience is people who love celebrating birthdays. It is natural for them to want to keep a
      record of the birthdays of their contacts. This way, they will never miss a birthday.

* **Project management**:
  * Set up Github Pages.
  * Created and assigned issues for milestone `v1.3`.
  <br>
* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Redefine equality amongst contacts.
    * Previously, equality between two contacts hinged on the fact that they had the same name. Since people
      can have friends with the same name but unique phone numbers, I changed CONNECTIONS to check for phone
      numbers instead to raise possible duplicate contacts.
  * Revamp Find
    * Find ('AND'-search) and FindAny ('OR'-search) can be applied names and/or tags.
    * Case Sensitivity to search (Find/FindAny).
      * Users can now opt for case-sensitive searches on Tags using the `c/` flag.
  * Wrote unit and integration tests for existing features.
    * Increase coverage from 72.15% to 72.59% (+0.43%). (Pull request [\#49](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/pull/49))
