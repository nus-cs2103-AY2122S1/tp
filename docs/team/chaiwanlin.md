## Project: EdRecord

EdRecord is a **desktop student management app, for teaching assistants to manage their student contacts**. 
The EdRecord codebase was initially adapted from [AddressBook Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/), a desktop address book application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

### Features implemented
* **Create module**
    * What it does: allows the user to create modules to store classes which students can be assigned to.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can assign students to classes in the modules to classify them. 
      Reduces mistakes by user by ensuring module is valid (a created module) instead of using tags.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing architecture.
    * Credits: adapted from AB3 `AddressBook` implementation.


* **Delete module**
    * What it does: allows the user to delete stored modules once useless.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can delete modules once it is useless so that modules saved do not pile up and waste space.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing architecture.
    * Credits:


* **Create class**
    * What it does: allows the user to create classes under modules which students can be assigned to.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can assign students to classes in the modules to classify them.
      Reduces mistakes by user by ensuring class is valid (a created class) instead of using tags.

* **Move student to class**
    * What it does: allows the user to assign students to classes under modules which they belong.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can assign students to classes in the modules to classify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing architecture.
    * Credits: 


* **Remove student to class**
    * What it does: allows the user to remove students from classes under modules which they do not belong.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can remove students from classes under modules which they do not belong to ensure user can rectify mistakes or update student classification.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing architecture.
    * Credits:


* **UI layout and colors**
    * What it does: change layout of UI to closer to that of a terminal CLI and add more distinctive colors.
    * Justification: This feature improves the look and feel of the product.
    * Highlights: It required a moderate understanding of JavaFX.
