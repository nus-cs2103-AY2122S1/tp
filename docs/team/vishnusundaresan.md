### Project: ClassMATE

ClassMATE is a desktop application designed for instructors of the CS2101 Module in NUS to easily store class and student details. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
