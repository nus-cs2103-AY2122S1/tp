### Project: Around the World in $80

Around the World in $80 is a desktop application that splits bills between different contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 22 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.[RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Jingwencloud&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&zFR=false)
