### Project: FriendBook

FriendBook is a desktop application for managing your contact details.
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Given below are my contributions to this project.

* **New Feature**: Added Birthday Reminder Capability.
  * What it does: Behind the UI, there is a background thread that periodically checks if a friend birthday is coming in a week or less.
  * Justification: This feature enables the user to get reminded of friends birthday without needing to remember the friends' birthday. The application does it for the user.
  * Highlights: These enhancements requires more knowledge on backgrounds threads and how it packages together with the current codebase.
  * More information about the reminder implementation can be viewed in the Developer Guide [here](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-f10-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#implementation).
  * Credits: *Implementation idea came from [here](https://edencoding.com/periodic-background-tasks/)*.

* **New Feature**: View Friend Info
  * What it does: Under the friend list, user can choose to double click a selected friend to display more information regarding selected friend.
  * Justification: There is `view` command to view more info of a selected friend but tying together with the UI would provide the user a more cohesive experience.
