### Project: Ailurus

Ailurus helps organizing committees account for details of their members. 
It provides users with convenient viewing and editing access to all information, thus providing much convenience in their work.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### New Feature

    * What it does: Allows the user to add a task to an existing member.
    * Justification: This feature is an essential part of the CRUD methods for tasks. 
    * Highlights: This command originally only supports adding a single task to the selected member, 
    the mass operation was implemented later.
