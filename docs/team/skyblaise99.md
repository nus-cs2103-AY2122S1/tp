### Project: Sellah

**Sellah** is a desktop application optimized for online sellers who prefer CLI over GUI. It is an address book that
contains the contact information and order details related to clients and partners. The user interacts with it using a
CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added Command History feature. (Pull request
  [\#139](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/139),
  [\#141](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/141),
  [\#145](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/145),
  [\#152](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/pull/152))
    * What it does: allows the user to navigate to previous commands using `↑` or `↓` keys.
    * Justification: This feature allows user to reuse previous input commands quickly without the need to retype again.
      This is especially helpful if the previous command is very long (e.g.
      `edit -c 1 -n Sora -pn 12345678 -e sora1999@gmail.com -a Block 126 #07-13, 126 Lor 1 Toa Payoh, Singapore 310126`)
