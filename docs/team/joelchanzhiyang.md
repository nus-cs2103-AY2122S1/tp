## Project: InsurancePal

InsurancePal is a client management software specially designed
to help manage the logistics of being an insurance agent.

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Code Contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-09-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=JoelChanZhiYang&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

**Major Enhancements**
* Implemented **claims command** ([#69](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/69), [#101](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/101), [#174](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/174))
  * **What it does**: The claim command allow users to add claims to the model.
  * **Justification**: Part of the role of an insurance agent is managing the insurance 
    claims of the client. The claim command allows the user to easily add, edit and delete 
    claims from the model, providing a new feature that would greatly benefit the target user
    of insurance agents.
  * **Highlights**:
    * This feature involves modification to the `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` components, requiring a 
      good understanding of how the entire application is interconnected. 
    * The `claim` command can add, edit and delete claims based on the title provided, and the number of 
      parameters given. Hence, its implementation require non-trivial logic to handle the different cases
      of valid and invalid inputs. 
    * Due to the high number of valid inputs, a substantial amount of automated tests are needed to prevent
      any regressions.
    * Due to complexity of the command, the command required a lot of exception handling to provide useful
      error messages for the user.
      
**Minor Enhancement**
