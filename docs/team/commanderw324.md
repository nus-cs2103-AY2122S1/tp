### Project: NetworkUS

NetworkUS is a desktop app for organizing contacts. It features seamless **group management**, allowing for **quick searches of contacts with desired traits** (i.e specialization) and hence **project group formation**. It is catered for **Computer Science Students** with fields such as Github and Linkedin. The app is optimized for the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** to allow swift access for keyboard users. The app is also complemented with **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to display the program.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ShowAlias Feature.
    * What it does: allows user to see the currently saved alias preferences.
    * Justification: user might have problems remembering all the alias they have set.
    * Highlights: The implementation is difficult due to the ObservableList. Require more in depth analysis in the future.
    
* **New Feature**: Added the Show Feature
    * What it does: allows the user to show a specific contact.
    * Justification: allows user to see full detail of specific contacts without truncations.
    * Highlights: This enhancement might need some UI Rework in the future.
    
* **New Feature**: Added the Delete Alias Feature
    * What it does: allows deletion of alias.
    * Justification: user needs to have the basic operation to delete an alias.
    
* **Enhancements to existing features**: 
    * Added Field of LinkedIn to the User.
    * Added Total Contacts in the footer.
    * Added automated tests for `linkedin`, `show` commands.
