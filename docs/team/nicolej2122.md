### Project: Intern Watcher

Intern Watcher (IW) is a desktop app for Human Resource Managers to manage internship applicants, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, IW can get your applicant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view applicant details.
    * What it does: Allows the user to toggle and view an applicant's academic and skill details.
    * Justification: Some users may be accustomed to solely using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to execute their commands. The view command allows such users display applicant details using the CLI rather than having to click on the different tabs. This feature enhances the product for these users.

* **New Feature**: Added `Skills` field to applicants.
