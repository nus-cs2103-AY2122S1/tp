### Project: SafeFor(H)All

SafeFor(H)All is a desktop app for hall admins to keep track of hall residentsâ€™ information to keep hall residents safe during the COVID-19 pandemic via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Modify `view` command to view more Resident/ Event details.
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to use `view` to see additional the Resident/ Event details in a sidebar when the user inputs the index of the specified event. Otherwise, it can be used to view the entire list of Residents/ Events when its index parameters are removed.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because having all the information in the main panel takes up a lot of space, making the app less user-friendly. This feature allows the user to retrieve the less commonly required information only if he/ she wants to.
  * Highlights: This feature required a split screen feature in the UI, using 2 panels to split up the main and additional information.

* **New Feature**: Added a mass operations function to the `edit` resident feature. 
    * What it does: This feature allows the user to edit the details of multiple residents in a single command, by inputting the residents' respective indexes.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might want to update multiple residents' details, such as their vaccination statuses or last FET dates, all in a single command.

* **New Feature**: Added a mass operations function to the `delete` resident feature.
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to delete multiple residents in a single command, by inputting the residents' respective indexes.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might want to delete multiple residents at a time, instead of inputting a new command line every time the user wants to delete a single resident.

* **New Feature**: Added the `edit` feature for events.
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to edit event details.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product since the user might want to update certain fields in an event given any changes.
  * Credits: The code written was adapted from the original AB3.
