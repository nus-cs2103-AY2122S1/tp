### Project: Staff'd

Staff'd is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with
it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added an add shift command that allows the user to add shift to a staff's schedule.
    * What it does: It searches the target staff with given index or name, and add a shift to
    * Justification: This is a fundamental command user needs when they manipulate the schedule of staffs. User can add
      a new shift to a specific slot on a specific day to the target staff.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to change the time of a specific shift.
    * What it does: It locates a shift first with the given index, staff's name, date and slot, then it updates the time
      of that shift with the given start time and end time.
    * Justification: This functionality improves the software's flexibility significantly, because when a shift is
      added, it will only be set to the default time. With this command, users can update the time according to the real
      situation.
