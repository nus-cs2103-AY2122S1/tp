### Project: BogoBogo

BogoBogo is a desktop inventory management application developed for small business owners. The user
interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the core components to enable placing orders.
    * What it does: allows the user to order items, add and remove items from order, and place the order to make a
      transaction.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can not only log items in inventory
      but also monitor business dynamics via the order system.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing model structures and new features to be added in the future. It
      required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required
      changes to multiple existing components while designing good interacting logic and abstraction between them.

* **New Feature**: Added transaction history.
    * What it does: allows the user to check past transactions made via order system and calculates essential historical
      business statistics.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can track transaction histories to
      better retrospect and manage business.
    * Highlights: This enhancement is added on top of the order system implemented in last feature to extend and make
      the order system interaction more complete and powerful.

* **Functional Code**: Added commands to enable order related operations.
    * Implemented `sorder`, `iorder`, `corder`, and `eorder` commands and their parsers.
    * What it does: allows the `Ui` component to parse user commands of order operations and activates the `Model`
      and `Storage` components to execute the operations and update the internal states.
