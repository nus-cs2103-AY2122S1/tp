### Project: Staff'd

Staff'd is a desktop staff tracking application used managing F&B staff. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

* **Code contributed**:  [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabAuthor=fullfatwasabi&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&tabType=authorship)

* **Enhancements implemented**

* **New Feature**: Changing Tabs
  * What it does: Allows the user to change tabs between the Schedule GUI and the Staff List.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to swap between these two tabs via CLI.

* **New Feature**: Schedule GUI
  * What it does: GUI to allow the users to see the schedules.
  * Justification: Allows our managers to easily see relevant schedule related information quickly, enhances usability of Staff'd.
  * Was pretty challenging for me and took up a lot of my time.

* **Changes to existing features**: Adding and removing fields (such as salaries and roles) from Person, as well as handling its related functionality e.g. saving, editing and testing.
  * Makes the Person class have more relevant fields and removing unnecessary ones.

* **Changes to existing features**: Updating the PersonCard look in the GUI to show necessary information such as absent periods and roles.
  * Similarly to the Schedule GUI point, was pretty challenging for me and took up a lot of my time.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Organized User Guide and added new sections such as GUI Breakdown, User Guide Usage, and Glossary. Improved sections such as Flag Legend and Introduction. [#330](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/330)
