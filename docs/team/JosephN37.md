# Project: SWEe-book

SWEe-book is a desktop application used for contact and task management pertaining to CS2103T and CS2101 module. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added FilterTasks command to filter tasks according to specified criterion.
    * What it does: Filters the task list according to the argument input (date, tasktype, priority, description, group)
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now filter and look through the tasks that they desire, for instance the list of tasks for a specific date, or one which has specific keywords.
    * Highlights: Since this enhancement allows user to filter tasks according to specified word / phrase, FilterTasks essentially encompasses a search function too 
    * Credits:
