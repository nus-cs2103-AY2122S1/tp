### Project: SalesNote

SalesNote is a desktop application that helps tailors to manage sales and keep track of a smaller, but more recurrent group of clients. 
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). 

Given below are my contributions to the project: 

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tanishq&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Tanishq4331&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&since=2021-09-17)

* **New Features**:
  * Implemented the sort order functionality, which lets users sort their orders based on different fields in a specified ordering. 
   This allows the user to prioritize larger orders or orders that are due soon. [\#154](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/pull/154)
  * Added the ability to filter tasks and orders based on their completion status. This allows the user to quickly view their
   incomplete tasks and pending orders. [\#96](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/pull/96), [\#95](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/pull/95)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
