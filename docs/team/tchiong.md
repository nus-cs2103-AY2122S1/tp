### Project: PlaceBook

PlaceBook (PB) is a desktop app for managing contacts and appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).** If you can type fast, PB can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `addApp`
    * What it does: Allows the user to add new Appointments to Placebook
    * Justification: This is a must-have feature for users to begin using the Appointment management feature.
    * Highlights: This feature contains checks to ensure that no duplicate appointments are added.
    * Credits: the implementation is similar to the AB-3 add feature.

* **New Feature**: List sorting
    * What it does: Allows the user sort the list based on either the timing and date of appointments or the description
      alphabetically
    * Justification: This is a helpful feature for users as it allows them to better view their appointments and improves
      the overall user experience.
    * Highlights: This feature assists the user in sorting their appointments and can be expanded upon in the future to
      include other conditions
    * Credits: the implementation was based on filter function in AB-3 and the base listApp command was made by Lehao

* **New Feature**: Ensures no conflicting timings when adding appointments
    * What it does: Ensures that there are no clashing timings when adding new Appointments
    * Justification: This is an important feature for users as it streamlines their workflow. By informing the users of
      clashes in their appointments when adding them, they are able to immediately rectify this problem
    * Credits: the implementation of timePeriod was done by LeHao
  
* **New Feature**: Implemented the Schedule Class for the modeling of Schedules
    * What it does: Models a real life schedule in the system, containing functions to manage appointments.
    * Justification: Sets the groundwork for future additions to the appointment manager of Placebook.

* **Other significant contribution**:
    1. Integrated the timePeriod class into the overall application.
        * What it does: ensures that Time Period works properly with the rest of the application
        * Justification: Allows for the usage of time period in future additions, streamlining the management of start and
          ending date times of appointments.
        * Credits: timePeriod class was coded by LeHao

    2. Removed all mentions of the old AB-3 from the code.
      * What it does: Makes the code more coherent to our design for Placebook.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=tchiong)

* **Project management**:
    * Took minutes for certain the weekly meetings
    * Created some issues as user stories

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
      * Added details of `findApp`
    * Developer Guide:
      * Added implementation details of the `addApp` feature. [#135](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/135)
      * Added implementation details of the filtering and sorting features `findApp` and `listApp` with keywords
      * Added more instructions for manual testing in the DG

* **Community**:
    * Reviewed PRs
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class
      (examples: [Reported bugs for group T11-2's team project during the mock PE](https://github.com/tchiong/ped/issues))
