### Introduction

I am the team lead and software developer for Financial Advisor Smart Tracker (FAST). 
I was in charge of the Integration of FAST.
Additionally, I was in charge of the overall management of the team.   
At the time of developing FAST, I was a Year 2 Computer Science Undergraduate.

### Project Overview: Financial Advisor Smart Tracker (FAST)

Financial Advisor Smart Tracker (FAST) is a desktop application targeted at financial advisors, 
for them to keep track of their clients as contacts. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

### Contributions to FAST

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the `sort` feature.
  * **What it does**: <br>
    The `sort` feature allows the user to manage and navigate their contacts easily.
    Users can currently sort by 3 different fields: `name`, `appointment`, `priority`.
    * `name`: sorts the contacts alphabetically.
    * `appointment`: sorts the contacts chronologically.
    * `priority`: sorts the contacts based on priority tags. 
      
  <br>
  
  * **Justification**: <br>
    Sort integrates other features (appointment & priority tags) of FAST to provide Financial Advisors (FA) a way to organize their contacts.
    FA can easily identity contacts that need their attention by their appointment and priority tags.

#### Enhancement to Existing Features

* **Enhancements to existing features**: UI changes.
  * **What it does**:
    <br> Added icons to each field. 
    <br> Added custom colors for tags.
    <br> Added text wrap for fields.
    
  <br>

  * **Justification**: 
    <br>
    Adding icons to each contact fields improve the user experience and brightens up the GUI.
    It also prevents the GUI from looking like a chunk of words. Users are able to easily spot each field.
    Adding custom colors to tags improve the user experience in easily identifying contacts with significant tags.
    Added Text wrapping for fields to prevent the GUI from overlapping with each other.
  
  <br>

  * **Highlights**: 
    <br>
    Created a reusable class for adding icons, any other future iterations that require additional icons can be
    easily implemented with this class.
    <br>
    Abstracted out a method for changing tag colors. Any changes to the tag color can be easily changed.
    <br>
    Text wrapping for each field so that they do not overlap with each other.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Set limit for user input fields.
  
  * **What it does**:
    <br>
    Prevents the user from inputting very long fields (that do not make sense) into FAST to prevent abuse
    of the GUI.
    
  <br>

  * **Justification**: 
    <br>
    After discussions with the team, we came to a conclusion that limiting the length of user input fields 
    is required to prevent abuse of the GUI where users are able to add in very long inputs that do not make sense
    (eg. 100 digits phone number). The specific character limits were decided as a team.
