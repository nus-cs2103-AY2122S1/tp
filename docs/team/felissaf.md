### Project: TAB

TAB is a desktop address book application that can help Teaching Assistants (TAs) manage their students' progress. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 24 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add students to a module. (Pull request [\#71](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/71))
    * What it does: It allows the user to add a student to a specified module one at a time.
    * Justification: This feature allows the TA to add a student to the module he or she is enrolled in. The feature also helps the TA to record the student's information.

  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete students from a module. (Pull request [\#71](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/71))
    * What it does: It allows the user to delete a specified student from a specified module one at a time.
    * Justification: This feature allows the TA to remove students from a module when the TA accidentally adds the wrong student or adds the student to a wrong module.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit students' information. (Pull request [\#98](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/98))
    * What it does: It allows the user to edit a specified student's information.
    * Justification: This feature allows the TA to update or correct inaccurate information about the specified student.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find students. (Pull request [\#98](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/98), [\#153](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/153))
    * What it does: It allows the user to find a student easily.
    * Justification: This feature allows the TA to find and view the student's progress easily and also allows the TA to get the student's information when needed.
    

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated list command to home command. (Pull request [\#98](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/98))
    * Justification: The command is updated to cater to TAB's logic while having the same functionality.


* **Testing**:
  * Wrote tests for all student-related classes to increase coverage by 20.60%. (Pull request [\#131](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/131))
  * Wrote tests for some other classes to increase coverage by 7.51%. (Pull request [\#146](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/146))
