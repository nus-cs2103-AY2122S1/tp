**HR Manager will help you manage the people to be interviewed, making the scheduling process **easier** and **faster** for your company!** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Hr Manager, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Hr Manager, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
