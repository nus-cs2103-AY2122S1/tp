**Notor** aims to help **mentors** who wish to keep tabs on their mentees, by providing **a quick way to take notes and mantain records on their mentees**. While it has a GUI, most of the user
interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Notor, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User
  Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Notor, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to
  start.
