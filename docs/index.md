**Doc'it is a desktop application for clinic staff to view, update, and onboard patient records, solving the inefficient paper records and files used today.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Doc'it, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Doc'it, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
