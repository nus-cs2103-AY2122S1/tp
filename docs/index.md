LingoGO! is a **desktop app** for **university students who use English as their first language** and are trying to **learn a
new language**. Founded on the widely established learning technique of **spaced-repetition**, LingoGO! takes all the
benefits of pen-and-paper flashcards in learning, and brings them to the next level with our **powerful search** and
**sharing
features** -- *without the hassle* of managing actual physical ones. Coupled with our unique **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and
an elegant **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to accompany it, LingoGO! is sure to delight you, and empower you on your
journey in mastering the new language you *have always wanted*.


* If you are interested in using LingoGO!, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing LingoGO!, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
