**UNIon is a desktop app for organizing various types of contacts in college**, optimized for use for the vast majority of computing students.
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface) based on **Unix**.

* If you are interested in using UNIon, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User
  Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing UNIon, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to
  start.
