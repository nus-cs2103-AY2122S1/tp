**GameBook is a desktop app designed for you to track your gambling performance.**
With simple commands, you will be able to add your gambling sessions into GameBook and view instant analysis of your gambling records.
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using GameBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing GameBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
