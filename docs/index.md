DukePro(f) is a schedule-planning desktop application that assists **university professors** in managing
their **consultations**, through the usage of an intuitive **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**<sup>1</sup>
and an easy-to-navigate **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**<sup>2</sup>.

It is named `DukePro(f)` (Duke-Professor) because our project's target audience is professors, and it is also a nod
to our CS2103T iP (individual Project), which was named `Duke`.

Amidst long hours of lectures and tutorials in the week, professors may still need to cater timeslots for student
consultations, which can be hard to come by and difficult to keep track of. This is where Dukepro(f)
comes in to help you out! 

With DukePro(f), you will be able to:

* Add your consultations (With details such as names of student(s), location of consultation, any remarks)
* Delete your consultations
* Edit your consultation details
* List all of your consultations
* List your next consultation
* List your free time slots for consultation booking
* Block certain time slots (to ensure your consultations don't clash with other commitments)
