NUS Mod Tracker is a **desktop app** designed for **NUS Computer Science (CS) students who are enrolled in the Academic Year 2021/2022 and onward** to **create their own academic plan**,
as well as to **keep track of their Modular Credits(MC) and modules taken**.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI).

* If you are interested in using NUS Mod Tracker, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing NUS Mod Tracker, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
