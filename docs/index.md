Advyze is a desktop application for managing your contact details as well as your daily tasks and schedules. 
Although it has a GUI, it is designed such that the user is able to primarily interact with the app using a CLI 
(Command Line Interface). 

* If you are interested in using Advyze, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in developing Advyze, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) will be a good place to start.
