CSBook is a **desktop app for Computer Science (CS) teaching assistants (TAs) to manage their students**. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface) as it is expected that CS TAs work faster with a CLI.

* If you are interested in using CSBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing CSBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
