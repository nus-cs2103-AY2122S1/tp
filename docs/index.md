**Sellah** is an address book containing the contact information and orders related to the clients and partners. The
information and status of each order can also be easily monitored by the user. This product makes it easy and convenient
to track orders and look for future cooperation.

* If you are interested in using Sellah, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User
  Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Sellah, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to
  start.
