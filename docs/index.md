gitGud is a **desktop application for storing and managing your friends' gaming information and schedules**.
It is dedicated to gamers like you and provides a gamer-themed experience with a focus on increasing your efficiency through
its typing-based interface.

Previously, keeping track of all of yours friends' gaming information and schedules can be difficult and time-consuming.
However, with gitGud, there is no need to get tilted (frustrated) by this anymore as gitGud provides you with a convenient
platform to manage essential gaming information of your fellow gamer friends.
