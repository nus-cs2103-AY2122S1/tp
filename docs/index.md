## What is TA<sup>2</sup>?

**Teaching Assistant's Assistant (TA<sup>2</sup>) is a desktop productivity application developed for teaching assistants to make their teaching journey smoother.**
With TA<sup>2</sup>, you can manage student information and keep track of the status of their assignments. Just type in
the corresponding commands and TA<sup>2</sup> will manage all these for you! No need to do all these manually!

## How is TA<sup>2</sup> different?

TA<sup>2</sup> is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface(GUI).
This means that if you are able to type fast, TA<sup>2</sup> will be able to manage student submissions much faster than other applications
that require you to use your mouse often. TA<sup>2</sup> sorts all the information that you enter behind the scenes and
presents it to you in an organised manner when you ask for it. TA<sup>2</sup> eliminates the problem of information overload
when trying to manage immense amounts of information. No more trying to filter out information on your own, TA<sup>2</sup>
will do it for you.
