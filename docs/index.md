*ComputingConnection* is for entrepreneurial students in NUS Computing who want to **keep track of other studentsâ€™ skill sets so that they can easily look for suitable people to work with on future projects.** *ComputingConnection* is optimized for Command Line Interface (CLI) over a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for efficiency with a keyboard.

You can use *ComputingConnection* to efficiently record information such as faculty, major, skills, programming languages, and remarks (and more!) of peers that you have encountered throughout university. *ComputingConnection* will allow you to remember and document your network of potential student partners for projects in the future.
