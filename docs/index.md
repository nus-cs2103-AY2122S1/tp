**Source Control** is a desktop app for CS1101S professors to manage the performance of their students.

Source Control is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Source Control can help you track your students’ performance faster than traditional GUI apps!


## Usage
* Keeps track of administrative info and academic records of large student intake.
* Analyzes the performance of individual, groups and the cohort in assessments.
