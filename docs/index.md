**Academy Directory is a desktop app for CS1101S tutors to manage their students.** Its main features are as follows:
- Manage studentsâ€™ personal details
- Track students' grades, Studio attendance, and participation
- Visualize data in Academy Directory

Academy Directory runs on all major operating systems! It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
