ManageMe is a **desktop app for time management and resource organisation, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ManageMe can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* If you are interested in using ManageMe, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.
  html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing ManageMe, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to
  start.
