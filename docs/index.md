* Fridgy is **a Food Inventory Manager** that makes it easy to reduce food waste by keeping track of what you have and when it expires.
* Fridgy's built-in **Recipe Tracker** matches recipe ingredients to ingredients in your inventory and helps to keep track of the quantity of ingredients.

If you are interested in using Fridgy, head over to the [**User Guide**](UserGuide.html).

If you are interested about developing Fridgy, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
