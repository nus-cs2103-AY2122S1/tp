Dash is a desktop application that acts as a *Dash*board for managing your contacts and tasks.  
Dash is a GUI application, but is mainly CLI(Command Line Interface) based in order to emphasise speed.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* If you are interested in using Dash, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Dash, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
