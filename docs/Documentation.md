**Setting up and maintaining the project website:**

* We use [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) to manage documentation.
* The `docs/` folder is used for documentation.
* To learn how set it up and maintain the project website, we followed the guide [_[se-edu/guides] **Using Jekyll for project documentation**_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jekyll.html).
* we noted these points when adapting the documentation to our project:
  * The 'Site-wide settings' section of the page linked above has information on how to update site-wide elements such as the top navigation bar.
  * :bulb: In addition to updating content files, we updated the config files `docs\_config.yml` and `docs\_sass\minima\_base.scss`.

**Style guidance:**

* Follow the [**_Google developer documentation style guide_**](https://developers.google.com/style).
