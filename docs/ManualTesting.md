       state after execution of the command regardless if the execution of the command is successful or not.
       To view the changes in `Tag` for the student being viewed in the result display, use `view 1` after the tag command.


#### Get Personal Detail
List of invariance to guide additional test case generation:
- At least one of `p/`, `e/`, or `te/` must be provided
- Name tag `n/` is optional; its use indicates intention to get personal detail of students whose name matches
  the given keywords
- Lack of phone number will not be explicitly shown, unless there are no other information to show.
- Current view of AcademyDirectory does not affect result
- View of AcademyDirectory always resets to the view that will be obtained when running [`ListCommand`](#listcommand)
- Order of tags present to `GetCommand` does not matter. `GetCommand` will prioritise showing phone number, followed
  by email address, followed by telegram handle.
- If duplicates of the same tag is given, the last tag will be used regardless of its validity.

Below are a few test cases which checks for the above. The test cases are by no means exhaustive.

1. Retrieving personal detail of all students while all students have a phone number.
    1. Prerequisites:
        - All students in the list must have a phone number
        - Run each test case twice, the first time by having all students listed using the `list` command,
          and the second time by having the view only show some students e.g. by using `filter` command
          on the tags. Expected outcome is the same in both cases for all test cases
    2. Test cases:
        1. `get p/`<br>
           Expected: Phone number of all students are shown in the result display.
        2. `get e/`<br>
           Expected: Email address of all students are shown in the result display.
        3. `get te/` <br>
           Expected: Telegram handle of all students are shown in the result display.
        4. `get p/ e/` <br>
           Expected: Phone number of all students are shown in the result display, followed by email address
           of all students.
        5. `get e/ p/` <br>
           Expected: Phone number of all students are shown in the result display, followed by email address
           of all students.
        6. `get e/ p/ te/` <br>

           and then by telegram handle.


2. Retrieving personal detail of all students. At least one student has no phone number and
   at least one student has a phone number.
    1. Prerequisites:

         \* [FIVE CHAR HASH] - DDD, dd MMM YYYY hh:mm:ss +0800<br/>
           | 		Initial Commit<br/>
         Note a few things:
          - Date and time for the last three commits should remain the same
          - The label "(HEAD)" and "(MAIN)" is on the latest commit i.e. the commit which does `clear`
          - The label "(OLD)" is on the commit in the _OLD_ branch i.e. the left branch
      3. New branch created on top of Two-way branch -> make former MAIN branch to OLD and new branch to MAIN <br/>
         Continuing from above, execute `undo` --> `undo` --> `add n/Bob e/bob@email.com te/@bob` --> `history` <br/>
         Expected: Something like the following should appear <br/>
         | * [FIVE CHAR HASH] - DDD, dd MMM YYYY hh:mm:ss +0800 (HEAD) (MAIN)<br/>

         \* | [FIVE CHAR HASH] - DDD, dd MMM YYYY hh:mm:ss +0800<br/>
         | | 		New student added: Alex<br/>
         |/<br/>
         \* [FIVE CHAR HASH] - DDD, dd MMM YYYY hh:mm:ss +0800<br/>
         | 		Initial Commit<br/>
         Note a few things:
          - Date and time for the last three commits should remain the same
          - The commits in the formerly "(MAIN)" branch i.e. the right branch, are now in the "(OLD)" branch 
            i.e. the left branch.
          - The commit formerly labeled as "(MAIN)" is now labeled as "(OLD)"
          - The label "(HEAD)" and "(MAIN)" is on the latest commit i.e. the commit which does `add n/Bob`

The above test cases tests for correctness for the basic behaviors of `HistoryCommand`. They don't have to be 
executed with the exact commands given; using different version controlled commands in different order may lead to slightly different
commit message and/or date time shown. However, the general behavior as demonstrated above should remain the same. The 
list of version controlled commands is in [here](DeveloperGuide.md).

        - Remove version control folder (Default is `data/vc`; refer to `preferences.json` for specific)
        - Start the application
   2. Test cases:
       1. Execute the following commands in sequence: <br/>
          `clear` --> `undo` --> `add n/Alex e/alex@email.com te/@alex` --> `history` -> `revert HASH`<br/>
          where `HASH` refers to the five character hash of the commit which executes `clear`, as shown by `history` <br/>
          Expected: Student list should be empty
       2. Continuing from above, run `history` <br/>
          Expected: Something like the following should appear <br/>
          | * [FIVE CHAR HASH] - DDD, dd MMM YYYY hh:mm:ss +0800 (MAIN)<br/>
          | | 		New student added: Alex <br/>
          \* | [FIVE CHAR HASH] - DDD, dd MMM YYYY hh:mm:ss +0800 (HEAD) (OLD)<br/>
          | | 		Academy Directory has been cleared! <br/>
          |/ <br/>
          \* [FIVE CHAR HASH] - DDD, dd MMM YYYY hh:mm:ss +0800<br/>
          | 		Initial Commit<br/><br/>
          Note a few things:
           - Date and time for initial commit should not change
           - No new commit is created
           - The label "(HEAD)" is now in the commit whose hash was passed to `revert`

The above test cases tests for correctness for the basic behaviors of `RevertCommand`. They don't have to be
executed with the exact commands given; using different version controlled commands in different order may lead to slightly different
commit message and/or date time shown. However, the general behavior as demonstrated above should remain the same. The
list of version controlled commands is in [here](DeveloperGuide.md).

#### Undo/redo changes
1. Undo a change 
    1. Prerequisite: Start with an empty commit history. To achieve this, do the following:
        - Remove version control folder (Default is `data/vc`; refer to `preferences.json` for specific)
        - Start the application
    2. Test cases:
        1. Execute the following commands in sequence: <br/>
           `clear` -> `undo`,<br/>
           Expected: Student list should be repopulated
        2. Continuing from above, run `undo` <br/>
           Expected: The following message should appear: <br/>
            "Unable to undo Academy Directory as requested ... Is there anything to undo?"
2. Redo a change
    1. Prerequisite: Completed the above two test cases for undo and made no other changes
    2. Test cases:
        1. Continuing from point 1.2, execute `redo` <br/>
           Expected: Student list should be cleared
        2. Continuing from above, run `redo` <br/>
           Expected: The following message should appear: <br/>
           "Unable to redo Academy Directory as requested ... Is there anything to redo?"

The above test cases tests for correctness for the basic behaviors of `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`. They don't have to be
executed with the exact commands given; using different version controlled commands may lead to slightly different
commit message and/or date time shown. However, the general behavior as demonstrated above should remain the same. The
list of version controlled commands is in [here](DeveloperGuide.md).

#### Help

1. Test general help
    1. Prerequisite: Application is started
    2. Test case: `help` <br>
       Expected: A pop-up window is shown summarizing the format of all commands for users, as well as a link to the web User Guide of Academy Directory
       Expected: All commands used in Academy Directory are shown, and the summary table does not lack any command. To assert this, compare the table to the
       actual User Guide web version and see the matched commands.


2. Test specific help
    1. Prerequisite: Application is started
    2. Test cases: 
       1. `help edit` <br>
          Expected: A pop-up window is shown with a customized help message (based on the User Guide of `edit` command) on how to use `edit`, including significance, format, and example.
       1. `help visualize` <br>
          Expected: A pop-up window is shown with a customized help message (based on the User Guide of `visualize` command) on how to use `visualize`, including significance, format, and example.
       1. `help ad` <br>
          Expected: No pop-up window is shown, and an error message is shown as status message explaining that there exists no instruction for command `ad`.
          Significance of the test case is that specific `help` can only be useful when the command is typed in full rather than in partial - to view help for command `add`, users need to type in `help add` exactly.
       1. `help r230thg4b0p2nnbtpbgetbi03` <br>
          Expected: No pop-up window is shown, and an error message is shown as status message explaining that there exists no instruction for the command.


3. Test functionality of pop-up window
    1. Prerequisite: Help window is already opened before by any mean, and is kept opened for testing
    2. Test cases: 
       1. Focus on the Main Window, do not close Help Window, and type in `help add` or any other equivalent command <br>
          Expected: The help window is refocused with its content change to the new `help` instead.
       1. Click on the `Copy UG Guide` button on the right side, and access the link <br>
          Expected: The User Guide web-version of Academy Directory can be accessed, meaning that the link is indeed copied.


#### Saving data _[Coming Soon]_

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files 
   1. Since data is stored locally, it has the potential to be corrupted or missing between uses.


***

## Graphical User Interface (GUI) Testing

These tests are primarily focused on testing both the appearance and the functionality of the GUI when used by the user.

### Visual Design

1. Test application visual design
    1. Prerequisite: Application is started, the Main Window is opened, users have not entered any command or cleared any data previously, and there are
       some students on the records.
    2. Test cases: 
       1. Assert that Academy Directory has a student list with the various student cards inside <br>
          Expected: Student list and student cards are shown to the users
       1. Assert that Academy Directory has 4 menus in the top left corner of the Main Window <br>
          Expected: There are 4 menus, one with grade logo, one with statistics logo, one with clock logo, and one with question logo
       1. Click on the first menu item with the Grade logo <br>
          Expected: 5 entries will pop up, showing users different options to show grades.
       1. Assert that Academy Directory has an opaque rectangle in the top-right corner of the Main Window <br>
          Expected: The rectangle is shown to the user, and users cannot edit it or remove it.
       1. Assert that Academy Directory has an opaque rectangle in the bottom-right corner of the Main Window <br>
          Expected: The rectangle is shown to the user, and users cannot edit it or remove it.
       1. Assert that Academy Directory has a command box at the bottom of Main Window <br>
          Expected: The command box is shown to users, with a placeholder message `Enter something`, and users can edit the command box.
       1. Type in `this is a test message` <br>
          Expected: The command box shows `this is a test message` - meaning that the command box is able to received user's request
       1. Expand Academy Directory to full screen <br>
          Expected: Background image also expanded, alongside other components of the internal controls (result display, student list, and status message). No other visual misbehavior of the User Interface (image is cropped, whitespace exists, or lacking in any visual design)
       1. Shrink Academy Directory to the smallest possible size <br>
          Expected: Academy Directory is not minimized completely as there is a minimal size for users to still see the data


### User Interface Functionality

2. Test Main Window User Interface functionality
    1. Test cases:
       1. Execute the command `help` <br>
          Expected: Status logger displays a message that informs user a general help message is being shown. Help Window is popped up 
       2. Resize the Help Window by expand it to full screen <br>
       Expected: Help Window is expanded to full screen without compromising the content inside (the message is not being minimized or expanded, users are able to view the message regardless of the size). All commands are inside the help message. To check, scroll the window and see whether commands `participation`, or `revert`, or `visualize` are in the table
       3. Close the help window <br>
          Expected: Help Window is closed successfully, without the Main Window being closed or affected as well
       1. Click on the logger display and try to edit the message <br>
          Expected: Users cannot edit the message or remove the message. Reason is to avoid confusion in usage of the application
       1. Enter `visualize` to the command box, and press enter <br>
          Expected: A box-whisker plot is shown to the users visualizing relative performance on student exam.
       1. Attempt to click on the bottom-right rectangle and remove the data visualization <br>
          Expected: Users cannot remove or manipulated the shown data.
       1. Enter `view 1` to the command box, and press enter <br>
          Expected: A visualized view of the student is shown in the bottom-right corner
       1. Click on the drop-down menu with "View Participation" on the current view <br>
          Expected: The menu is dropped, and users can see the summary of student participation and attendance of CS1101S studio
       1. Click on the drop-down menu with "View Test Score" on the current view <br>
          Expected: The previous menu is closed, the clicked menu is dropped, and users can see the summary of student test score of CS1101S
       1. Enter `list` to the command box, and press enter <br>
          Expected: The `view` visualization of student information does not disappear even when the application is working at the background
       1. Click on the first menu, then click on `Show RA1` entry <br>
          Expected: The equivalent to user input `show RA1` will be executed on Academy Directory
       1. Click on the first student card of the student list <br>
          Expected: A visualized view of the student is shown in the bottom right corner.

## Performance testing

### Visualization with large Academy Directory _[Coming soon]_

* Testing of large number of the `Visualize` function with a large number of students in Academy Directory
  * Potentially affects runtime and if so, Academy Directory might require optimization.

### Limit test Academy Directory capacity _[Coming soon]_

* Testing the `Student` capacity that Academy Directory can handle
  * Things to look out for: 
    * Potential general loss in performance e.g less responsive buttons, longer startup time, longer time taken to process commands

***

## Compatibility testing

### Cross-OS Compatibility _[Coming soon]_

* Testing of Academy Directory on all mainstream OS such as `Windows`, `MacOS` and `Linux`.


* Testing of Academy Directory on more obscure OS such as different `Linux` distributions e.g `Kali Linux`.


***

## Portability testing

### Transfer of Academy Directory _[Coming soon]_

* Testing transfer of Academy Directory between identical mainstream OS e.g from `MacOS` to `MacOS`.

* Testing transfer of Academy Directory between different mainstream OS e.g from `MacOS` to `Windows`.
  * Things to look out for: 
    * Hypothetically, a potential increase in time taken to execute `Visualize` after transfer e.g `Macbook A` to `Macbook B` and back to `Macbook A` without changing any files.
