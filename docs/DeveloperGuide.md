LingoGO! is a **desktop app** for **university students who use English as their first language** and are trying to **learn a
new language**. Founded on the widely established learning technique of **spaced-repetition**, LingoGO! takes all the
benefits of pen-and-paper flashcards in learning, and brings them to the next level with our **powerful search** and **sharing
features** -- *without the hassle* of managing actual physical ones. Coupled with our unique **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and
an elegant **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to accompany it, LingoGO! is sure to delight you, and empower you on your
journey in mastering the new language you *have always wanted*.

LingoGO! currently supports **all languages that can be represented on your computer** and has the following main features:
* Addition, deletion, and editing of flashcards.
* Finding and filtering of flashcards by keywords and conditions.
* Importing and exporting of flashcards to be shared with others.
* Testing your knowledge in a questionnaire of flashcards.

Detailed information about these features can be found under the [Modes](UserGuide.html#modes) and [Commands](UserGuide.html#commands) sections in the user guide.

## Overall Design

This section gives an overview of the software architecture of the system, and details on how each major component functions.

</div>

### Architecture

The *Architecture Diagram* below explains the high-level design of the app.

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

**Main components of the architecture**

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/MainApp.java).
It has the following responsibilities:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the app consists of **four components**.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the app.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above):

* Defines its API in an interface with the same name as the component.
* Implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, which follows the corresponding API interface in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class, which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component),

We can see an illustration of this in the (partial) *Class Diagram* below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details on each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component contains the logic for the graphical user interface (GUI) that users see.

An overall *Class Diagram* for this component can be found below:

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The `UI` component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several sub-components (e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FlashcardListPanel`, etc.) which come together to make up the entire user interface. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Flashcard` objects residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component is responsible for the overall flow of the commands in LingoGO!, linking `UI`, `Model`, and `Storage` together.

A (partial) *Class Diagram* of the `Logic` component can be found below:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FlashcardAppParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This creates a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses, e.g. `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a flashcard).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated in a `CommandResult` object which is returned by `Logic`.

The *Sequence Diagram* below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the *Class Diagram* above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FlashcardAppParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g. `AddCommandParser`).
* `XYZCommandParser` uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g. `AddCommand`) which the `FlashcardAppParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g. `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible (e.g. during testing).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component holds the data of LingoGO! in memory while the app is running.

A *Class Diagram* of the `Model` component can be found below:

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component:

* Stores the flashcard app data, i.e. all `Flashcard` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueFlashcardList` object).
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Flashcard` objects (e.g. results of a search query) as a **separate filtered list** which is exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Flashcard>` that can be 'observed' (e.g. the `UI` can be bound to this list so that the `UI` automatically updates when the data in the list changes).
* Stores the slideshow app data i.e., all `Flashcard` objects in the slideshow (which are contained in a `Slideshow` object). This is exposed as a `ReadOnlySlideshowApp` object.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, it should make sense on its own without depending on other components).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/lingogo/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component stores all of LingoGO!'s data so that it can be saved and retrieved in subsequent runs of the app.

A *Class Diagram* of the `Storage` component can be found below:

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component:
* Can save both LingoGO! data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* Inherits from both `FlashcardAppStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if the functionality of only one is needed).
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `lingogo.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Feature Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filter feature

#### Description
The filter feature allows users to quickly select a group of flashcards to be shown in the displayed flashcards list
of the GUI. This effectively enables users to "prepare" a batch of flashcards for a test session. The command
accepts various conditions from the user to filter the flashcards with (e.g. what type of
language, which card indexes).

#### Implementation

The filter feature is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` and implements `updateFilteredFlashcardList`
which returns an unmodifiable view of filtered flashcards in the GUI.

The filter feature also relies on a nested `FilterBuilder` class within `FilterCommand`. Multiple filters can be
given by the user in one command, however only one predicate (filter) can be accepted by
`Model::updateFilteredFlashcardList` to produce the filtered flashcards. `FilterBuilder` helps by combining multiple
predicates into a single predicate.

`FilterBuilder` is also a mutable class which allows processed user inputs to be directly set as variables within a
`FilterBuilder` instance. A mutable design is acceptable for `FilterBuilder` since it only has a one-time usage within
`FilterCommand`. Furthermore, set-variable methods in `FilterBuilder` reduces the need to add unnecessarily
complex constructors or factory methods when more types of filters are added.


The following *Sequence Diagrams* show how the `filter` command works:

[![](images/filterCommand/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)](images/filterCommand/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

![SetFilterReferenceSequenceDiagram](images/filterCommand/SetFilterReferenceSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Number of filter conditions that users can input per command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accept multiple conditions per command.
  * Pros: More convenient for users, creating a better user experience.
  * Cons: Harder to implement and more difficult to test (due to large permutations of different conditions to
    consider).

* **Alternative 2:** Only accept one condition per command.
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: Less convenient for users.

**Aspect: Mutability of `FilterBuilder`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make it mutable.
    * Pros: No need for complex constructors and easier for more types of filters to be added in the future.
    * Cons: Less defensive code and easier for bugs to arise due to programmer error.

* **Alternative 2:** Make it immutable.
    * Pros: More defensive code.
    * Cons: There is a need for multiple constructors to handle optional user inputs due to a lack of set-variable
      methods. Furthermore `FilterCommandParser` may become needlessly complex.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Export feature

#### Implementation

The export feature uses the `CSVWriter` class from the `OpenCSV` package which generates a CSV file line by line in the file specified by the user. The file-writing operations can be found in the `exportToCsvFile` method in `FileUtil`.

The following *Sequence Diagrams* show how the `export` command works:

[![](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)

![ExportToCsvReferenceSequenceDiagram](images/ExportToCsvReferenceSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Import feature

#### Implementation

The import feature uses the `CSVReader` class from the `OpenCSV` package to check if the given CSV file
is in the correct CSV format. The file-reading operations can be found in the `importCsvFileContent` method in `FileUtil`. During the execution of the `import` command, the CSV content is further validated to be valid flashcards and are not duplicates before they are added to the flashcard list.

The following *Sequence Diagrams* show how the `import` command works:

[![](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)

![ImportFromCsvFileReferenceSequenceDiagram](images/ImportFromCsvFileReferenceSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find feature is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` implements `updateFilteredFlashcardList` which returns an unmodifiable view of flashcards matching the specified keywords in the GUI.

The find feature relies on the `FindCommandParser` and `PhraseContainsKeywordsPredicate`. Multiple keywords can be 
given for both English and foreign phrases. `FindCommandParser` uses `PhraseContainsKeywordsPredicate` to select flashcards that matches the keywords.

The following *Sequence diagram* shows how the `find` command works:

[![](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to search in foreign language:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow non-full match.
  * Pros: Will not miss out any related flashcards that is related to the keyword provided.
  * Cons: May output a lot more flashcards than the user's desired outcome.

* **Alternative 2:** Only allow full match.
  * Pros: Only exact match will be output, user will only see flashcards that are exactly the keyword.
  * Cons: Too restrictive, will not output phrases that contains more than the keyword.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List feature

#### Implementation

The list feature is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` and implements `updateFilteredFlashcardList` which returns an unmodifiable view of the flashcards in the GUI.

The list feature relies on the `ListCommandParser` and `FlashcardInGivenFlashcardListPredicate`. In order to generate a list of random flashcards, a random stream of integers is used to get the flashcards from the main list of flashcards.

The following *Sequence diagram* shows how the `list` command works:

[![](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Generating list of flashcards:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Randomize the list of flashcards.
    * Pros: Users are able to use flashcards more effectively.
    * Cons: Harder to implement and needs a random stream of `Index`.

* **Alternative 2:** Output list up to `n`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Does not add value to the user's learning experience.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Slideshow feature

#### Description

The slideshow feature displays the current list of flashcards shown in [List mode](UserGuide.html#list-mode) one at a time.
In [Slideshow mode](UserGuide.html#slideshow-mode), users can test how well they remember their flashcards by entering their answers for each flashcard
and getting feedback on whether they are right or wrong. Users may also navigate between flashcards in the slideshow.

#### Implementation

The slideshow feature is facilitated by `ModelManager`.
It extends `Model` and implements the methods `startSlideshow`, `stopSlideshow`, `isSlideshowActive`, `slideshowNextFlashcard`,
`slideshowPreviousFlashcard`, `answerCurrentSlide`, `displayCurrentAnswer`, `getSlideshowApp`, and `getCurrentSlide`.

The above methods in turn facilitate the following commands:

| Command Class | Command | Usage |
| `SlideshowCommand` | [`slideshow`](UserGuide.html#testing-with-a-set-of-flashcards-slideshow) | When the user enters [Slideshow mode](UserGuide.html#slideshow-mode). |
| `AnswerCommand` | [`answer`](UserGuide.html#answering-a-flashcard-answer) | When the user enters an answer for the currently shown flashcard. |
| `NextCommand` | [`next`](UserGuide.html#moving-to-the-next-flashcard-in-slideshow-mode-next) | When the user navigates to the next flashcard in the slideshow. |
| `PreviousCommand` | [`previous`](UserGuide.html#moving-to-the-previous-flashcard-in-slideshow-mode-previous) | When the user navigates to the previous flashcard in the slideshow. |
| `StopCommand` | [`stop`](UserGuide.html#exiting-slideshow-mode-stop) | When the user exits [Slideshow mode](UserGuide.html#slideshow-mode). |

Below is a *Class Diagram* of the `SlideshowApp` component, the class in charge of this feature.

![SlideshowAppClassDiagram](images/SlideshowAppClassDiagram.png)

The `SlideshowApp` class encapsulates all state and operations related to the slideshow, and
is exposed via the `ReadOnlySlideshowApp` interface.
`SlideshowApp` tracks the current state of the slideshow, such as whether the [Slideshow mode](UserGuide.html#slideshow-mode) `isActive`, and whether `isAnswerDisplayed` for the current slide. It also contains a `Slideshow` component, which tracks the list of flashcards in the current slideshow.

The following *Sequence Diagrams* show how the `slideshow` command works:

[![](images/SlideshowSequenceDiagram.png)](images/SlideshowSequenceDiagram.png)

[![](images/StartSlideshowAppReferenceSequenceDiagram.png)](images/StartSlideshowAppReferenceSequenceDiagram.png)

The *Reference Sequence Diagram* above shows the various state changes within `SlideshowApp`.
When a certain property is changed, the UI updates itself accordingly.
The relevant `UiPart` listens to changes in these properties using the `ChangeListener` class provided by the `java.beans` package.

For instance, when `isActive:BooleanProperty` becomes true, the UI will go into [Slideshow mode](UserGuide.html#slideshow-mode).
Below is a code snippet on how this is implemented in `FlashcardListPanel.java`.

{% highlight java %}
readOnlySlideshowApp.isActiveProperty().addListener(new ChangeListener<>() {
  @Override
  public void changed(ObservableValue<? extends Boolean> o,
    Boolean oldVal, Boolean newVal) {
      if (newVal.booleanValue()) {
        assert !flashcardListPanel
                .getChildren()
                .contains(slideshowPanel.getRoot())
                : "FlashcardListPanel.java: Slideshow already being displayed";
        flashcardListPanel.getChildren().add(slideshowPanel.getRoot());
      } else {
        assert flashcardListPanel
                .getChildren()
                .contains(slideshowPanel.getRoot())
                : "FlashcardListPanel.java: No slideshow to exit from";
        flashcardListPanel.getChildren().remove(slideshowPanel.getRoot());
      }
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

### Exporting flashcards to CSV file
The `data` directory in this section refers to the directory named `data` which is located in the same directory as the jar file to be tested.

1. Exporting to CSV file while all flashcards are listed.
    1. Prerequisites: List all flashcards using the [`list`](UserGuide.html#listing-flashcards-list) command. Multiple flashcards are in the list. The `data` directory does not contain a file named `file.csv`.
    1. Test case: `export file.csv`<br>
       Expected: A CSV file named `file.csv` is created in the `data` directory.
       This CSV file contains 3 columns with the headers "Language", "Foreign", "English" from left to right, while the rows contain
       the data for **all** the flashcards in the app.

1. Exporting a set of filtered flashcards to CSV file.
    1. Prerequisites: Use the [`filter`](UserGuide.html#filtering-flashcards-by-conditions-filter) or [`find`](UserGuide.html#locating-flashcards-by-keywords-find) commands to obtain a filtered list of flashcards. This filtered list of flashcards
       should contain a **strict subset** of all the flashcards in the app. The `data` directory does not contain a file named `file.csv`.
    1. Test case: `export file.csv`<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous, but now the CSV row data should **only** contain the data for the flashcards in the filtered list of flashcards.

1. Export successfully overwrites existing file content.
    1. Prerequisites: An empty file named `file.csv` should already exist in the `data` directory.
    1. Test case: `export file.csv`<br>
       Expected: The contents of `file.csv` have been overwritten to contain the flashcard data as per the previous test cases.

### Importing flashcards from CSV file
The `data` directory in this section refers to the directory named `data` which is located in the same directory as the jar file to be tested.

1. Importing valid CSV file.
    1. Prerequisites:
      * A valid CSV file named `file.csv` is located in the `data` directory.
      * This CSV file should contain flashcard data for some **new** flashcards not found in the app currently, and some flashcards that are **already** in the app currently.
      * See the User Guide [here](UserGuide.html#importing-flashcards-import) for more information on what constitutes a valid CSV file.
    1. Test case: `import file.csv`<br>
       Expected: All the flashcard data in `file.csv` is successful imported as flashcards in the application, and displayed in the
       current list of flashcards. Note that the duplicated flashcards set up above in the prerequisites will not be imported into the application.
    1. Test case: `import file.csv` again immediately after the previous test case<br>
       Expected: The command result informs the user that the application already contains all the flashcards the user is trying to
       import.

1. Importing CSV file with invalid headers.
    1. Prerequisites: A CSV file named `file.csv` located in the `data` directory, with headers that do not follow the required format as specified in the User Guide [here](UserGuide.html#importing-flashcards-import).
    1. Test case: `import file.csv`<br>
       Expected: The command result informs the user that the headers in the CSV file are not in the correct format.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Appendix G: Proposed future features

Given below are brief summaries for some proposed future features of LingoGO!.

### Grouping flashcards

Grouping flashcards gives users the ability to create sets of flashcards that they can easily load into the app and test themselves with.


One possible implementation would be to create a `group` command, which takes in a name as the only command parameter (e.g. `group Korean`).
The `FlashcardApp` class would then contain an extra field containing the sets of flashcards that have been grouped together.


As for long term storage, each flashcard within flashcardapp.json would have an **extra key-value pair called groups**, which specify
the groups that a flashcard belongs to. Below is an example of what this might look like.

```
{
  "flashcards": [ {
    "languageType": "Chinese",
    "englishPhrase": "Good Morning",
    "foreignPhrase": "早安",
    "groups": ["Chinese greetings"]
  }, {
    "languageType": "Chinese",
    "englishPhrase": "Good Afternoon",
    "foreignPhrase": "午安",
    "groups": ["Chinese greetings"]
  }, {
    "languageType": "Chinese",
    "englishPhrase": "Good Night",
    "foreignPhrase": "晚安",
    "groups": ["Chinese greetings"]
  }, {
    "languageType": "Tamil",
    "englishPhrase": "Hello",
    "foreignPhrase": "வணக்கம்",
    "groups": ["Tamil greetings"]
  } ]
}
```

### Statistics

Showing statistics after a user finishes testing with a set of flashcards would make it more convenient for them to track their
progress. Potential statistics to be shown include:
* Number of correct answers out of wrong answers
* Percentage improvement from previous test
* Specific flashcards the user got wrong

One possible implementation would be to add a `Group` class to encapsulate
* A group of flashcards
* Score history for that group of flashcards (only the most recent score will be kept)

### Recommendations

To encourage users to focus on the flashcards they are weaker at remembering, LingoGO! should prioritize displaying flashcards that users
score the most poorly in.


This can be done by changing the order in which flashcards are displayed to be dynamic.
Whenever users load the app or list their flashcards, the top flashcards in the displayed flashcard list will be those that they score the worst at. The `FilteredList<Flashcard>` within `ModelManager` can be sorted according to the flashcard scores to achieve this.
