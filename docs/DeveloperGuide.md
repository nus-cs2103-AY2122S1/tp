Around the World in $80 (AWE) is a desktop application for keeping track of spending and expenditure during travels, splitting 
expenses with travel-mates, and facilitating easy recollection of debts at the end of every trip. AWE is the world's
only bespoke app designed for group travellers.

The app promises to revolutionize the group-travel space. With AWE, bills can be split and monitored in a centralized
manner that maximizes the potential for disputes and maximizes the efficiency of payment and recollection of debts.

AWE's vision is a more interconnected world where relationships are more easily built and maintained.
Our mission is to accomplish through a user-centric approach that seeks to provide the user with what they need, at the
tip of their fingertips. This document marks the first step towards the accomplishment of that mission, and the
beginning of your journey around the world.

### Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="280" />
  <br>
    Fig 1. Architecture Diagram
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.


<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/awe/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/awe/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletecontact 1`.

<p align="center">

</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" alt="Component Managers" width="300" />
  <br>
      Fig 3. Component Managers
</p>

The sections below give more details of each component.

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/awe/ui/Ui.java)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" alt="Ui Class Diagram" width="750" />
  <br>
    Fig 4. Ui Class Diagram
</p>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ViewPanel`, `NavigationButton` etc. 
All these, except for `GroupButtonListener` and `PersonButtonListener` in `NavigationButton`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/awe/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.


<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### View Panel
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UiViewPanelDiagram.png" alt="Ui View Panel Diagram" width="750" />
  <br>
    Fig 5. Ui View Panel Diagram
</p>

The `ViewPanel` consist of the following parts:
* `GroupListPanel`
* `ContactListPanel`
* `ExpenseListPanel`
* `TransactionSummary`
* `PaymentListPanel`

Each panel will display the corresponding list accordingly. The ViewPanel will only show up a single list panel at a time. 
We have decided to opt for this way of implementation due to the following:
* Able to make use of existing AB3 implementation of `PersonList`
* Will not increase code complexity as compared to both list using the same panel.
* Able to toggle easily with CLI commands

In addition to using CLI command, we will also be implementing the toggling of list panel with the use of buttons.

#### Navigation Buttons
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UiNavigationButtonDiagram.png" alt="Ui Navigation Button Diagram" width="600" />
  <br>
    Fig 6. Ui Navigation Button Diagram
</p>

The `NavigationButtonPanel` consist of the following parts:
* GroupViewButton
* ContactViewButton

Clicking each button will show the respective list view in `ViewPanel`. The clicking of the button is handled by `EventHandler`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/awe/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" alt="Logic Class Diagram" width="550"/>
  <br>
    Fig 7. Logic Class Diagram
</p>

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AweParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletecontact 1")` API call.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Delete Sequence Diagram" width="750" />
  <br>
    Fig 8. Delete Contact Sequence Diagram
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteContactCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ParserClasses.png" alt="Parser Classes" width="600"/>
  <br>
    Fig 9. Parser Classes
</p>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AweParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddContactCommand`) which the `AweParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/awe/model/Model.java)

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="clear: both; page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Model` component,

* stores AWE data
    * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
    * all `Group` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGroupList` object).
    * all `Expense` objects (which are contained in a `ExpenseList` object).
    * all `TransactionSummary` objects (which are contained in a `TransactionSummaryList` object).
    * all `Payment` objects (which are contained in a `PaymentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person`/`Group`/`Expense`/`TransactionSummary` /`Payment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.png" alt="Person Class Diagram" width="300" />
  <br>
    Fig 11. Person Class Diagram
  <br>
</p>

The `Person` component, 

*  Handles the storing of each contact in AWE.
*  Stores a `Name` and a `Phone` object for each person.
*  Stores any amount of `Tag` objects.

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>

  <img src="images/ExpenseClassDiagram.png" alt="Expense Class Diagram" width="300" />
  <br>
    Fig 12. Expense Class Diagram
  <br>
</p>

The `Expense` component, 

*  Handles the storing of each expense in AWE.
*  Expenses will store a reference to all instance of `Person` involved in the expenses.
*  Stores a `Cost` and a `Description` for each `Expense`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/GroupClassDiagram.png" alt="Group Class Diagram" width="350" /><br>
  <br>
    Fig 13. Group Class Diagram
</p>

The `Group` component, 

*  Handles the data of each group in AWE.
*  Groups will store a list of reference to all `Expense` and `Person` in the group.
*  Stores a `GroupName` for each group.
*  Stores any amount of `Tag` object.

  <br>
</p>

The `TransactionSummary` component,

*  Handles the display of all the individual split expenses in a group.
*  Stores a reference to a `Person` and a `Cost`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/PaymentClassDiagram.png" alt="Payment Class Diagram" width="200" />
  <br>
    Fig 15. Payment Class Diagram
  <br>
</p>

The `Payment` component,

*  Handles the display of all the payments to be made between contacts in a group.
*  Stores 2 `Person` objects and a `Cost`.

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/awe/storage/Storage.java)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" alt="Storage Class Diagram" width="550" />
  <br>
    Fig 16. Storage Class Diagram
</p>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both AWE data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AweStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* has the `IndividualAmount` class which is composed of a `Person` and a `Cost`, similar to the entries within the `HashMaps` within `Expense`. Since `HashMap` is not serializable in Json format, we utilize a list of `IndividualAmount` objects to store the `HashMap`.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

**Note: The words contact and person will be used interchangeably in this section.** 

### Add Contact Feature

The add contact mechanism is facilitated by defining a Person model and adding a Unique Person List field to
AWE. The Person model contains a `Name` field containing the name of the contact, a `Phone` field containing the
number of the contact, and optional `Tags` to attach to the contact.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes an `addcontact` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/AddContactActivityDiagram.png" alt="Add Contact Activity Diagram" width="420" />
  <br>
    Fig 17. Add Contact Activity Diagram
</p>

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addcontact` mechanism behaves at each step.


Step 1. A valid `addcontact` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `AddContactCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the relevant prefixes.
It also checks that the name is valid and all members specified are in the contact list.
It returns a `AddContactCommand`.

Step 3. `AddContactCommand` runs its execute() method which checks if a contact with the same name has already been
created. If not, the newly created contact is added into the AWE model. Upon successful execution, `CommandResult` is returned.

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence operation shows how the `addcontact` operation works.

    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Case-sensitivity of `Name` parameter in `addcontact` command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Name` is case-sensitive (for instance, `Alex` and `alex` are treated as unique names, and effectively, unique persons as well).
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Pros: Many cultures have names that are common. Allowing users to enter the same name but in different case allows unique users with the same name to store their contacts.
  * Pros: Many cultures have names that are spelled in different case. For instance, in Singapore, the characters "s/o" (often used to denote "son of") are spelled in different case by different people. Should multiple users have the same name but different case-spelling, it would be respectful to accept all versions of the name, regardless of case.
  * Pros: Provides the user with a greater level of flexibility and user-choice.
  * Cons: Possibility of user referring to the wrong person in commands due to creation of multiple persons with the same names but in different case.
  
* **Alternative 2 :** `Name` is not case-sensitive.
  * Pros: Difficult to implement.
  * Pros: Safeguards user from erroneously referring to the wrong person in commands.
  * Cons: Difficult for users with the same name.
  * Cons: May offend some people if the casing of their name is regarded as unacceptable or not given recognition.
  * Cons: User has limited flexibility and restricted user-choice.
  
* **Justification**
  * The two cases described in the alternatives, where multiple persons of the same name but different case are necessary, are quite prevalent.
  * Moreover, we trust the user to be careful with the casing of the `Name` when entering the commands.
  * As such, we chose to make the `Name` parameter case-sensitive.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Create Group Feature

The create group mechanism is facilitated by defining a Group model and adding a Unique Group List field to 
AWE. The Group model contains a `GroupName` field containing the name of the group, an `ArrayList` of `Person`
objects who are members of the Group, an `ArrayList` of `Expense` objects that keeps track of the expenditures of the 
Group, a `HashMap` that contains details of how much each member has paid in total across the expenses, and a `HashMap`
that contains details of the total expenditure incurred by each member across the trip.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `createGroup` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/CreateGroupActivityDiagram.png" alt="Create Group Activity Diagram" width="400" />

    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `creategroup` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `creategroup` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `CreateGroupCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the relevant prefixes.
It also checks that the group name is valid and all members specified are in the contact list.
It returns a `CreateGroupCommand`.

Step 3. `CreateGroupCommand` runs its execute() method which checks if a group with the same name has already been
created. If not, the newly created group is added into the AWE model and all members within the group are updated in
the model. Upon successful execution, `CommandResult` is returned.

The following sequence operation shows how the `creategroup` operation works.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/CreateGroupSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Create Group Sequence Diagram" width="750" />
  <br>
    Fig 21. Create Group Sequence Diagram

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/CreateGroupRef.png" alt="Create Group Reference Sequence Diagram" width="650" />
  <br>
    Fig 22. Create Group Reference Sequence Diagram
</p>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command for `creategroup`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create Travel Group with specified members and tags.
    * Pros: Intuitive for user to create a travel group with specified members and tags.
    * Pros: Provides user with convenience of setting up a travel group with minimal commands.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.
    * Cons: Easier for user to make an erroneous command.


* **Alternative 2 :** Create Travel Group only.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Command has single responsibility. Easy to remember the sole purpose of `creategroup` command.
    * Cons: Unintuitive for user as travel group is created without any members or tags.
    * Cons: Inconvenient for user to use multiple commands to set up a travel group.

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* **Justification**
    * User will have at least one member in mind when creating a group.
    * As such, it is only natural for the `creategroup` command to support addition of members and tags into the group
      upon creation.
    * This minimizes the number of commands a user has to make in setting up a functional Group.
    * As such, it is better to choose Alternative 1, as this provides the user with a far better user experience.

**Aspect: Case-sensitivity of `GroupName` parameter in `creategroup` command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `GroupName` is case-sensitive (for instance, `BALI` and `bali` are treated as unique group names, and effectively, unique groups as well).
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Pros: If the user goes on multiple trips to the same place, they can keep track of multiple groups by adding multiple groups of a similar name, different by case.
  * Pros: If multiple groups of users go on trips to the same place, they can keep track of multiple trips by adding multiple groups of a similar name, different by case.
  * Pros: Provides the user with a greater level of flexibility and user-choice.
  * Cons: Possibility of user referring to the wrong group in commands due to creation of multiple-groups with the same names but in different case.


* **Alternative 2 :** `GroupName` is not case-sensitive.
  * Pros: Difficult to implement.
  * Pros: Safeguards user from erroneously referring to the wrong group in commands.  
  * Cons: Difficult for users who go on a trip to the same place multple times to keep track of their trips.
  * Cons: Difficult to keep track of trips or groups if multiple groups of users go on trips to the same place.
  * Cons: User has limited flexibility and restricted user-choice.

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* **Justification**
  * The two cases described in the alternatives, where multiple groups of the same name are necessary, are quite prevalent.
  * Moreover, we trust the user to be careful with the casing of the `GroupName` when entering the commands.
  * As such, we chose to make the `GroupName` parameter case-sensitive.

* **Improvements**
  * The solution of making the `GroupName` parameter case-sensitive to permit users to create groups of the same name should the use case demand it is not ideal.
  * In the long-term, we plan to make `GroupName` case-insensitive, but this will require changes to the command.  
  * One such change currently being worked on is to include a `DATETIME` parameter for this command, so that users who go on multiple trips to the same location at different times can keep track of their trips.
  * Other solutions are necessary to satisfy the use case wherein different sets of members wish to go on a trip to the same location at the same time and wish to create groups of the same name.
  * A solution that is being considered is to check for uniqueness of the group by checking that the members in each group are different.
  * However, this will require changes to other commands as presently most commands operate on the assumption that `GroupName` is unique (case-sensitivity considered).

### Delete Group Feature

The delete group mechanism is facilitated by maintaining the constraint that every `Group` has a unique `GroupName`.
This allows the `Model` class to easily retrieve the Group based on the name entered by the user and remove the group from the model.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `deletegroup` command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `deletegroup` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `deletegroup` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `DeleteGroupCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the relevant prefixes.
It also checks that the group name is valid (does not have any non-alphanumeric characters).
It returns a `DeleteGroupCommand`.

Step 3. `DeleteGroupCommand` runs its execute() method which checks if a group with the same name has been
created in the past. If so, this group is retrieved from the model. Subsequently, the group is removed from the AWE.
Upon successful execution, `CommandResult` is returned.


The following sequence operation shows how the `deletegroup` operation works.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command for deletegroup:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete based on `GroupName`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Difficult for user to make an erroneous command.
    * Cons: Long user command.  
    * Cons: Requires imposition of constraint that group names are unique.
    

* **Alternative 2 (index based):** Delete based on index position in `ObservableList`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Short user command  
    * Cons: Unintuitive for user.
    * Cons: Easy for user to make an erroneous command.
    

* **Justification**
    * Group contains large mass of information such as multiple expenses, individual expenditures, and payments.
    * This information is unrecoverable once deleted.
    * As such, it is better to choose Alternative 1, as this makes it difficult for user to accidentally delete a group.

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Aspect: Internal delete mechanism:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Retrieve group from list and delete.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Pros: Easier to modify in future.
  * Cons: Extra step of retrieval leads to slower execution.
  

* **Alternative 2 (name based):** Delete based on `GroupName`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Pros: Process is completed faster.
  * Cons: Might cause issues in case of future modifications.
  

* **Justification**
  * Retrieving the group and subsequently deleting the group is a slower process.
  * However, the alternative implementation relies on the uniqueness of the `GroupName` field of `Group` objects.
  * Should we modify or remove the constraint, the alternative implementation would require significant alterations.
  * To make the feature more extendable, we choose alternative 1.

### Group Edit Features
The group edit mechanism is facilitated by defining a Group model and adding a Unique Group List field to
AWE. The Group model contains a `GroupName` field containing the name of the group, an `ArrayList` of `Person`
objects who are members of the Group, an `ArrayList` of `Expense` objects that keeps track of the expenditures of the
Group. The group edit mechanism comprises the following commands. 
* `groupeditname`
* `groupaddcontact`
* `groupremovecontact`
* `groupaddtag`
* `groupremovetag`

Given the high degree of similarity in implementation and design considerations between these commands, only the
`groupeditname` command will be explained comprehensively in this section.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `groupeditname` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `groupeditname` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `GroupEditNameCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the relevant prefixes.
It also checks that both the old and new group names are valid.
It returns a `GroupEditNameCommand`.

Step 3. `GroupEditNameCommand` runs its execute() method which updates the name of the group in the AWE model.
Upon successful execution,`CommandResult` is returned.

</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command for `groupeditname`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Edit each attribute of a group with separate commands.
  * Pros: Significantly shorter commands.
  * Pros: Provides user with convenience of editing a group with minimal input.
  * Cons: More commands for user to work with. Harder to remember relevant commands.

* **Alternative 2 :** Edit groups with a single command, as is implemented in `editcontact`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Inconvenient for user to edit a person if there are multiple attributes they wish to change.
  * Cons: Easy for user to make an erroneous command.

* **Justification**
  * Unlike Person objects, Group objects have many more attributes that users may wish to change.
  * The length of a single edit command that can change all attributes will be extremely long if a user wishes to add
  and remove multiple members simultaneously.
  * This significantly increases the chances of users inputting erroneous commands as well
  * Hence, editing attributes of a group using separate commands is more convenient and appropriate.

### Find group feature

The find group feature supports both single keyword and multi keyword search. This allows the displayed view panel to show the entries related to the search keywords entered by the user.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `findgroups` command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/FindGroupsActivityDiagram.png" alt="Find Groups Activity Diagram" width="300" />
  <br>
    Fig 27. Find Groups Activity Diagram
</p>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `findgroup` operation behaves at each step:

Assuming the programs only have the initial data when the user first starts the app, the `FilteredList` should contain only 2 groups - London and Bali.

Step 1. When the user executes `findgroups London` command, the message is passed into `LogicManager` and parsed by `AweParser`.

Step 2. `FindGroupsCommandParser` is created and the arguments are parsed by it. The arguments are used to create `GroupContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `FindGroupsCommand` is returned to the `LogicManager`.

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 3. The `LogicManager` then calls `FindGroupCommand` `execute(model)` method, which updated the `FilteredList<Group>` in `ModelManager`. Thereafter, the `FilteredList<Group>` should contains only London.

Step 4. The GUI listens for updates in the `FilteredList<Group>` and updates the display to display London only.

Step 5. `CommandResult` is returned to the `LogicManager`, which also switches the view panel to `GroupsListPanel` if needed. See UI implementation below for more details of switching view panel.

Step 6. The output from `CommandResult` is then displayed as an output for the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `findgroups` operation works:

### Add expense feature

The add expense mechanism is facilitated by defining an Expense model and adding an Expense List field to
`Awe`. The Expense model contains a `Person` field containing the payer of the Expense, a `Cost` field
containing the cost of the expense, a `List` of `Person` objects that keeps track of the people involved in the
expense, a `HashMap` that contains details of how much each member has paid in total for the expense.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `addexpense` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/AddExpenseActivityDiagram.png" alt="Add Expense Activity Diagram" width="570" />

</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addexpense` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `addexpense` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `AddExpenseCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the relevant prefixes.
It also checks that the group name is valid and all members specified are in the specified group.
It returns a `AddExpenseCommand`.

Step 3. `AddExpenseCommand` runs its execute() method which adds the newly created expense involving the into the
relevant group members into the group and the group is updated in the AWE model.Upon successful execution,
`CommandResult` is returned.

The following sequence operation shows how the `addexpense` operation works.

<p align="center">

  <br>
    Fig 32. Add Expense Reference Sequence Diagram
</p>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command for `addexpense`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create Expense with specified group and group members.
    * Pros: Intuitive for user to create an expense with specified group and group members via their names.
    * Pros: Provides user with convenience of creating an expense with minimal input.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.
    * Cons: Easier for user to make an erroneous command.


* **Alternative 2 (index based):** Create Expense with based on index position in `ObservableList`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Inconvenient for user to add an expense as they have to check again the index of both the person and group.
    * Cons: Easy for user to make an erroneous command.

* **Justification**
    * Each person has a unique name and the implementation for adding an expense based on a person's and group's 
      name is simple.
    * Users may need a long time to find the index of a person or group if the list of either is very long.
    * Hence, adding expenses based on the specified person and group name is more appropriate.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find Expenses Feature

The find expenses mechanism is facilitated by `Group`. Each group has a unique group name and also an expense list 
required for finding expenses within a group.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `findexpenses` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/FindExpensesActivityDiagram.png" alt="Find Expenses Activity Diagram" width="320" />

</p>

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `findexpenses` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes a valid `findexpenses eat gn/London` command. This prompts the `LogicManager` 
to run its execute() method.

Step 2. The `FindExpensesCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the group name prefix.
It also checks that the group name is valid (does not have any non-alphanumeric characters). The arguments are 
used to create `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `FindExpensesCommand` is returned to the `LogicManager`.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` then calls `FindExpensesCommand` `execute(model)` method, which updates the 
`FilteredList<Expense>` in `ModelManager` using the predicate created in step 2.

Step 4. The GUI listens for updates in the `FilteredList<Expense>` and updates the display accordingly.

Step 5. `CommandResult` is returned to the `LogicManager`, which also switches the viewpanel to `ExpensesListPanel` if needed.

Step 6. The output from `CommandResult` is then displayed as an output for the user.


The following sequence operation shows how the `findexpenses` operation works.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command for findexpenses:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Find based on `GroupName`
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Long user command if group name is long.
    * Cons: Requires imposition of constraint that group names are unique.


* **Alternative 2 (index based):** Find expenses in the group indicated by index position in `ObservableList`
    * Pros: Short user command with just the index.
    * Cons: User needs to check for the right index of the group.
    * Cons: Easy for user to make an erroneous command.


* **Justification**
    * Each group has a unique name and can be used easily in the implementation to find expenses within the specified group. 
    * Users may need a long time to find the index of the group if the list of groups is very long.
    * This would be more inconvenient for the user.
    * Hence, finding expenses based on the specified group name is more appropriate.

### Delete Expense Feature

The delete expense mechanism is facilitated by the addition of an `ExpenseList` field within the `Awe` object maintained by the model.
Each `Expense` belongs to a `Group` object, also maintained within the `Awe`.
Deletion of an expense must be accompanied by deletion of the expense from the `Group` object to which it belongs.
The command allows the user to delete an expense based on the index position of the expense in the page viewed by the user.
This means that the user is constrained to only being permitted to delete expenses when they are viewing a list of expenses; that is, after they enter the `findexpenses` or `expenses` command.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `deleteexpense` command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/DeleteExpenseActivityDiagram.png" alt="Delete Expense Activity Diagram" width="420" />

<p align="center">

</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `deleteexpense` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `deleteexpense` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `DeleteExpenseCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the `INDEX` input.
It returns a `DeleteExpenseCommand`.

Step 3. `DeleteExpenseCommand` runs its execute() method which checks if the `INDEX` entered is within the range of the size of the list of expneses seen by the user.
If so, the `Expense` at the `INDEX` position is deleted from the `ExpenseList`. The `ObservableList` within `ExpenseList` is updated, meaniing the UI updates and the user can see the new list of expenses, without the deleted expense.

Step 4. The `Group` to which this expense belongs is retrieved from the `ExpenseList`.
The expense is subsequently deleted from the `expenses` field present in the `Group` object.
The updated `Group` is then placed back into the `GroupList` within the `Awe`.

Step 5: Upon successful execution, `CommandResult` is returned.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: User command for deleteexpense:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete based on index position in `ObservableList`
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Short user command.
    * Cons: Less intuitive for user.
    * Cons: Easy for user to make an erroneous command.

* **Alternative 2 (description based):** Delete based on `description`
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Difficult for user to make an erroneous command.
    * Cons: Long user command.
    * Cons: Requires imposition of constraint that expense description names are unique.


* **Justification**
    * Expenses, unlike Groups, do not contain a large volume of information.
    * This information is unrecoverable once deleted.
    * However, the damage to a user as a result of an error is not significant. The user can re-enter the details with a single command.
    * Therefore, the need to protect the user from erroneous decisions is not significant.
    * Furthermore, many expenses are likely to have similar descriptions. Constraining users to using unique descriptions for expenses is likely to compromise the user experience.
    * As such, it is better to choose Alternative 1, as this allows the user to quickly delete expenses, and not compromise on the flexibility of the user.

### Calculate Payments Feature

The purpose of this feature is to provide users with a simple set of transactions that would allow all debts within the group to be settled.
The UI mechanism is facilitated by the addition of a `PaymentList` field of `Payment` objects, present within the `Awe` object maintained by the model.
The functionality of this feature is facilitated by the fact that group objects maintain two hashmaps: -
* `paidByPayers`, which maintains how much each member of the group has paid (total payments) during the course of the trip.
* `splitExpenses`, which maintains how much expenditure each member of the group has incurred (total expenditure) during the course of the trip.
These maps allow calculations with respect to how much each individual is owed, and how much each individual owes.
  
#### The Algorithm
The invariant maintained is that the sum of all payments made (values within `paidByPayers`) should equal the total expenditures incurred by the group (values within `splitExpenses`).
Define surplus as the net amount each individual is owed by others. This ultimately means that some members have negative surplus, and some have positive surplus.
The goal is to ensure that the deficits balance the surpluses with the minimum number of transactions.
To assist with the tracking of each individual and their surplus, an inner `Pair` class was created with a `Person` field and a primitive double field for the surplus.

* Initialize an empty list of Pairs and an empty list of `Payment` objects.

* Iterate through the `members` of the group and retrieve each individual's total payments and total expenditures.

* Calculate the surplus of each individual by subtracting their total expenditures from their total payments.
Initialize a `Pair` object with the `Person` object of the individual, and their surplus. Add this pair to the list if the surplus is not 0.

<p align="center">
    <a href="#tableofcontents">Click here to return to table of contents</a>
</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* Iterate until the list is empty and perform the following steps.
  * Sort the list in ascending order of surplus. This means that those who owe more are placed in the earlier part of the list and those who are owed more are placed towards the end of the `Pair` list.
  * Retrieve the first `Pair` and last `Pair` in the list. It is invariant that the first pair will have negative surplus and the last pair will have positive surplus.
  * Check to see which pair has a smaller magnitude. Define this value to be `SMALL_VAL`.
  * Create a `Payment` object with a `Cost` of `SMALL_VAL`, and payee and payer as the two individuals within the first pair and last pair retrieved respectively. Add this `Payment` object to the list of `Payment` objects.
  * If the pairs do not have equal magnitude, remove the pair with the surplus value of smaller magnitude from the list. Calculate the new surplus value of the other pair to be the sum of the surpluses of both pairs. Update the other pair with this new surplus value and place it back into the list.
  * If the pairs do have equal magnitude, remove both pairs from the list.
  
* Return the list of `Payment` objects.

    Fig 40. Calculate Payments Activity Diagram
</p>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `calculatepayments` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `calculatepayments` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `CalculatePaymentsCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the `GROUP_NAME` prefix.
It checks that the `GROUP_NAME` is valid (does not have any non-alphanumeric characters).
It returns a `CalculatePaymentsCommand`.

Step 3. `CalculatePaymentsCommand` runs its execute() method which checks if a group with the `GROUP_NAME` entered by the user has been
created in the past. If so, this group is retrieved from the model.

Step 4. Subsequently, the **Algorithm** is used to tabulate a list of `Payment` objects.

Step 5. The `PaymentList` field is updated with the generated list of payments, triggering a change in the UI to show the user the list of payments.

Step 6. Upon successful execution, `CommandResult` is returned.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Algorithm utilized for calculatepayments:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Prioritize settling of bigger debts 
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Smaller number of transactions.
    * Cons: Larger value transactions.

* **Alternative 2:** Prioritize settling of smaller debts
    * Pros: Smaller value transactions.
    * Cons: Greater number of transactions.
    * Cons: More difficult to implement.

* **Justification**
    * The size of the transaction matters less to the user than the volume of transactions.
    * Moreover, an easier implementation reduces the possibility of bugs.
    * As such, we chose to prioritize the settling of bigger debts in our algorithm.

### UI
AWE has multiple lists / views to display such as for `groups`, `contacts` and `expenses`.

The display, called view panel, will only be able to show up 1 view at a time depending on the command. It is of upmost importance to get it to display the correct view.

To achieve the toggling between each view panels, we implemented the following:
* An enumeration `UiView` to contain the following `CONTACT_PAGE`, `GROUP_PAGE`, `EXPENSE_PAGE`, `TRANSACTION_SUMMARY`, `PAYMENT_PAGE`. Each enum represents a different view.
* `CommandResult` was given 6 more boolean fields, each representing a different view as well.
* `MainWindow` checks for the 6 boolean fields in `CommandResult` and passes `UiView` to `ViewPanel` for toggling the view.

The following activity diagram shows how the `MainWindow` checks and sends the `UiView` to `ViewPanel`.

#### Proposed Implementation
**Aspect: Navigating between different view**

* **Alternative 1**: Make use of JavaFx's tab
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Unable to fully customized the layout. Have to use the standard JavaFx's tab layout.
  
* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Replacing the child of the view panel node<br>
    (Refer to [JavaFx tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html) for more information about JavaFx)
    * Pros: More customizable in terms of layout.
    * Pros: Able to make use of existing codes.
    * Cons: More classes to implement to handle the toggling between views.
    
* **Justification**
    * We want to place the command result display below the buttons according to our [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/VwuDOdHr7CSyDUWb4Kwkmx/CS2103T-tP?node-id=0%3A1).
    * Using JavaFx's tab will not let us customize the layout as such.
    * Hence, replacing the child of a view panel is more appropriate.
    
#### Ui Navigation Buttons
To improve the usability of AWE, buttons are implemented into the Ui to allow switching of view easily.

However, only 2 main views can be toggled by the buttons - Contacts page and Groups page.

Navigation Buttons is designed using Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. 
* View: Buttons
* Controller: EventHandler
* Model: Backend codes for displaying the list

To achieve this, the following is implemented:
* 2 buttons (`GroupViewButton` and `ContactViewButton`) for the user to click.
* Event listener for each button - `GroupButtonListener` and `ContactButtonListener`. The event listener works by calling `ViewPanel#toggleView` when the button is clicked.

</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the button mechanism behaves at each step. In this example, the button used is `GroupViewButton` but it can also be replaced with `ContactViewButton`.

Step 1. When `GroupViewButton` is initiated, an event listener `GroupButtonListener` is created and used.

Step 2. Once the user clicks on `GroupViewButton`, the event listener will trigger and the `GroupButtonListener#handle` will run. This calls `ViewPanel#toggleView` and passes `UiView.GROUP_PAGE` as parameters. 

Step 3. `ViewPanel` will change the child of itself to `ContactListPanel` (Refer to [JavaFx tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html) for more information about JavaFx). Hence, GUI will update to show contact page

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* travels in groups
* wants to split expenses in a convenient and efficient manner
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Travellers have big notes that make settling payments inconvenient.
Most travel groups often designate one person to pay.
This method of settling payments poses a vexing task of splitting costs at the end of the day or on-the-spot.
Our app effectively splits bills between different contacts to serve this purpose.
