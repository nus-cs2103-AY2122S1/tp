### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="300" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `deletevendor vid/123`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `GuestListPanel`
, `VendorListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Guest` and `Vendor` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `PocketHotelParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses
   e.g., `CheckInNewGuestCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to check in a guest).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for
the `execute("deletevendor vid/123")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletevendor vid/123` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagramVendor.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteVendorCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PocketHotelParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CheckInNewGuestCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown
  above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CheckInNewGuestCommand`) which
  the `PocketHotelParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CheckInNewGuestCommandParser`, `DeleteVendorCommandParser`, ...) inherit from
  the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the vendorbook and guestbook data i.e., all `Vendor` and `Guest` objects.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Guest` or `Vendor` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_
  list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Guest>` or `ObservableList<Vendor>` that can
  be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list
  change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `GuestBook`, which `Guest` references. This allows `GuestBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Guest` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both vendor book data, guest book data, archive data, and user preference data in json format, and read them
  back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `GuestBookStorage`, `VendorBookStorage`, `ArchiveStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be
  treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Book Management

**PH** allows the user to manage vendors and guests.

As mentioned in the `Model` section earlier, there are three different types of lists:

1. GuestBook (Management of guests)
2. VendorBook (Management of vendors)
3. Archive (Management of archived guests; currently not exposed to the user)

All the lists are managed by the `ModelManager` which supports some common operations across them, with certain
variations depending on which list we are currently executing the operation on.

Some common operations include:

* `addvendor` for vendors and `checkin` for guests - creates the entity and adds to the respective books.
* `editvendor` for vendors and `editguest` for guests - edits the entity and updates the book accordingly.
* `deletevendor` for vendors and `deleteguest` for guests - removes the existing entity from the respective book.
* `listvendor` for vendors and `listguest` for guest - renders all the entities of the respective book.
* `clearvendor` for vendors and `clearguest` for guest - removes all the entities from the respective book.

By segregating the model into its respective books/lists, we felt that this embraced **OOP** concepts, as it reduces
coupling and increases cohesion.

The following class diagram shows the general structure of a `GuestBook`. The same concepts were applied when building
the `VendorBook` and `Archive`.

<img src="images/GuestBookClassDiagram.png" width="500" />

The `GuestBook` implements the `ReadOnlyGuestBook` interface. The `getGuestList()` method returns an `ObservableList` of
guests. `ObservableList` makes use of the Observer pattern, as it notifies the `ModelManager` of any changes that occur
in the guest list, and reflect those changes onto the **GUI**.

### Toggling between vendor and guest list

Other than toggling between the two lists via the **GUI**. The user can make use of the commands `listguest`
and `listvendor` to toggle between the two. After certain commands like `filterguest` and `filtervendor`, the list also
gets toggled automatically for the user. The toggling is executed depending on the state of the `CommandResult`, after
executing the user command.

`MainWindow` has a function `toggleTab()` that reads in the state of the `CommandResult` and renders the correct list
accordingly.

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens to the `MainWindow` of the UI component when a user inputs a
command.

![ToggleTabActivityDiagram](images/ToggleTabActivityDiagram.png)

### Checking in a Guest

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `checkin` command was mostly based off the original AB3 implementation, with changes made to
support the `Archive` and with curated fields tied to a guest. The `checkin` command makes use of the filtered guest
list to search for the guest to be checked in to see whether they are a duplicate guess and `Archive` class to determine
if the user is trying to check in a guest that has been archived, which are both not allowed. This is done through the
implementation of `Model` called `ModelManager`. The operation
`ModelManager#getFilteredGuestList()` gets the last shown list of guests in the UI, after which a search is done to see
if the list contains the guest to check in. If the guest is not found, the details of the guest will be added. If the
guest is found, which means that there is a duplicate guest, the operation will not be allowed. In the event that the
guest cannot be found in the last shown list, the operation
`ModelManager#getArchivedGuest(PassportNumber passportNumber)` checks if the user is trying to check in a guest that has
been archived, which is not allowed.

The `checkin` command is facilitated by the `CheckInNewGuestCommandParser` and `CheckInNewGuestCommand` of PH. The
following sequence diagram shows how the `checkin` operation works:

![CheckInNewGuestSequenceDiagram](images/tracing/CheckInNewGuestSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a checkin command.

![CheckInNewGuestActivityDiagram](images/tracing/CheckInNewGuestActivityDiagram.png)

### Checking in a returning Guest

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `returncheckin` command was mostly based off the original AB3 implementation, with changes
made to support the `Archive` and with curated fields tied to a guest. The `returncheckin` command makes use of the
filtered guest list to search for the guest to be checked in to see whether they are a duplicate guess, which is not
allowed, and `Archive` class to determine if the user is trying to check in a guest that has been archived. This is done
through the implementation of `Model` called `ModelManager`. The operation
`ModelManager#getFilteredGuestList()` gets the last shown list of guests in the UI, after which a search is done to see
if the list contains the guest to edit. If the guest is not found, the details of the guest will be added. If the guest
is found, which means that there is a duplicate guest, the operation will not be allowed. In the event that the guest
canno bet found in the last shown list, the operation
`ModelManager#getArchivedGuest(PassportNumber passportNumber)` checks if the user is trying to check in a guest that has
been archived, which is the purpose of this command.

The `returncheckin` command is facilitated by the `CheckInReturningGuestCommandParser` and
`CheckInReturningGuestCommand` of PH. The following sequence diagram shows how the `checkin` operation works:

![CheckInReturningGuestSequenceDiagram](images/tracing/CheckInReturningGuestSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a checkin command.

![CheckInReturningGuestActivityDiagram](images/tracing/CheckInReturningGuestActivityDiagram.png)

### Editing a Guest

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `editguest` command was largely based off the original AB3 implementation, with changes made
to support the `Archive` and edit by the guest details instead of index in list. The `editguest` command makes use of
the filtered guest list to search for the guest to be edited and `Archive` class to determine if the user is trying to
edit a guest that has been archived, which is not allowed.

This is done through the implementation of `Model` called `ModelManager`. The operation
`ModelManager#getFilteredGuestList()` gets the last shown list of guests in the UI, after which a search is done to see
if the list contains the guest to edit. If the guest is found, the details of the guest will be edited.

In the event that the guest cannot found in the last shown list, the operation
`ModelManager#getArchivedGuest(PassportNumber passportNumber)` checks if the user is trying to edit a guest that has
been archived, which is not allowed.

It is worth noting that the passport number of a guest cannot be edited.

![EditSequenceDiagramGuest](images/EditSequenceDiagramGuest.png)

### Editing a Vendor

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `editvendor` command was largely based off the original AB3 implementation, with changes made
to edit a different model, `Vendor` and edit by the vendor details instead of index in list.

The difference between the Guest and Vendor model is that Vendors cannot be archived. Therefore, the implementation of
the `editvendor` command is the same as the `editguest` command, but only the `VendorBook`
(the `GuestBook` equivalent for vendors) has to be searched.

![EditSequenceDiagramVendor](images/EditSequenceDiagramVendor.png)

### Charging a guest

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `chargeguest` is a new command implemented for the invoice to work nicely together.
The `chargeguest` would identity the guest by their passport number and vendor by their vendor id.
The service provided by the vendor would be charged to the assigned guest with the important information such as
ServiceName, Quantity, Cost, CompanyName.

The `chargeguest` command would increment the quantity for duplicate items.

The `chargeguest` command is facilitated by the `ChargeGuestCommandParser` and `ChargeGuestCommand` of **PH**. The
following sequence diagram shows how the `chargeguest` operation works:

![ChargeguestSequenceDiagram](images/ChargeGuestSequenceDiagram.png)

![ChargeguestActivityDiagram](images/ChargeGuestActivityDiagram.png)

### Checking out a Guest

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `checkout` command builds upon the original AB3 implementation of 'delete', with changes made
to delete the guest from the model by the guest details instead of index in list. The 'checkout' command first generate
an invoice for the guest if vendor services were engaged during his/her stay. After which, the guest is deleted from the
model, and then archived.

The `checkout` command makes use of the filtered guest list to search for the guest to be checked out and `Archive`
class to archive the guest.

This is done through the implementation of `Model` called `ModelManager`. The operation
`ModelManager#getFilteredGuestList()` gets the last shown list of guests in the UI, after which a search is done to see
if the list contains the guest to check out.

If the guest is found, a check is done to see if the guest engaged any vendor services (by seeing if he/she has any
chargeables). As mentioned earlier, the invoice is generated only if the guest has chargeables.

Once the invoice (if any) is generated, the chargeables (if any) of the guest will be cleared using the operation
`Guest#clearChargeables()`.

The guest is then deleted from the model using `ModelManager#deleteGuest(Guest guest)` and added to the archive using
`ModelManager#addArchivedGuest(Guest guest)`.

![CheckoutSequenceDiagram](images/CheckoutSequenceDiagram.png)

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The filter feature makes use of the `Model#updateFilteredGuestList` and `Model#updateFilteredVendorList` operations,
where each function takes in a `Predicate<Guest>` and `Predicate<Vendor>` respectively. To avoid repetition, we will
cover how the
`filterguest` command is implemented. The `filtervendor` command follows the exact same logic with its own unique
fields.

The `filterguest` command is facilitated by the `FilterGuestCommandParser` and `FilterGuestCommand` of **PH**. The
following sequence diagram shows how the `filterguest` operation works:

![FilterGuestSequenceDiagram](images/FilterGuestSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterGuestCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Given above is an example of a user filtering guests by a tag, deluxe. The end result is a filtered list of guests with
the tag, deluxe. The execution of the above example follows the same flow as all the other commands. One important to
take note is that, the `FilterGuestCommandParser`
returns a `GuestPredicate`. This `GuestPredicate` implements `Predicate<Guest>`, and the instance instantiated by the
parser is what gets passed into `Model#updateFilteredGuestList` to achieve the end result. `filtervendor` makes use of a
class `VendorPredicate` that follows the same idea.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `filterguest` command, `filtervendor` follows
the same flow.

![FilterGuestActivityDiagram](images/FilterGuestActivityDiagram.png)

### Deleting a Guest

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `deleteguest` command was largely based off the original AB3 implementation, with changes made
to support the `Archive` and delete by the guest details instead of index in list. The `deleteguest` command makes use
of the `GuestBook` and `Archive` class to search for the guest to be deleted.

This is done through the implementation of `Model` called `ModelManager`. The operations
`ModelManager#getGuest(PassportNumber passportNumber)` and`ModelManager#getArchivedGuest(PassportNumber passportNumber)`
are used to check if the guests details can be found in Pocket Hotel (Either in the archive or currently checked in). If
the guest details is found in either locations, it would be deleted.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagramGuest.png" width="800" />

### Deleting a Vendor

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `deletevendor` command was largely based off the original AB3 implementation, with changes
made to delete a different model, `Vendor` and delete by the vendor details instead of index in list.

The difference between the Guest and Vendor model is that Vendors cannot be archived. Therefore, the implementation of
the `deletevendor` command is the same as the `deleteguest` command, but only the `VendorBook`
(the `GuestBook` equivalent for vendors) has to be searched.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagramVendor.png" width="800" />

### Clear all Guest

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `clearguest` command was largely based off the original AB3 implementation.
The `clearguest` command makes use
of the `GuestBook` and removes all guest on the list.

<img src="images/ClearGuestSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

### Clear all Vendors

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `clearvendor` command was largely based off the original AB3 implementation.
The `clearvendor` command makes use
of the `VendorBook` and removes all Vendors on the list.

<img src="images/ClearVendorSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

### Invoice Generation

#### Implementation

Invoices in Pocket Hotel was created using the [iText7 Core](https://itextpdf.com/en/products/itext-7/itext-7-core)
library, which provides an API to create PDF documents in Java.

The implementation of invoice generation can be found in the `Invoice` class which contains almost all the code for
generating invoices. The `Invoice` class is meant to be used as a static method and should not be instantiated. It has
only one method that has the public access modifier is the static method `Invoice#generatePdfInvoice`
The other static methods are private helper functions to perform the generation of the PDF.

<img src="images/InvoiceBreakdown.png" width="450" />

An invoice has 5 components:

1. Invoice header
2. Billing details: Includes the guest name and their allocated room number
3. The invoice table: Contain services the guest used during their stay as well as the total cost. Each row contains,
   the item number (row number), the name of the vendor, their vendor ID, service type, quantity and cost per unit, as
   well as line cost (quantity multiplied by cost per unit) are included
4. A short note of thanks
5. Page number

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the invoice is created by `Invoice#generatePdfInvoice`.

<img src="images/GeneratePdfInvoiceSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

Referring back to the components that we have to include in the invoice. The `InvoiceNewPageHandler` would add
the invoice header and the page number. The `addGuestBillingDetailsToPdf` adds the billing details, `addInvoiceTableToPdf`
adds the invoice table and `addThankYouParagraphToPdf` adds a short note of thanks.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`
, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Front-desk receptionists at small-scale hotels

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts (both vendors and guests)
* prefers to have everything centralized in one application
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* tired of using pen and paper to keep track of contacts

**Value proposition**: Automate front-desk operations, elevating guest experience and lightens the front desk's
workload.

1. Editing a vendor while all vendors are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all vendors using the 'listvendor' command. Alternatively, click on the "Vendors" tab to view
       the list of vendors.

    1. Test case: `editvendor vid/001 n/Jeremy Western Delivery`<br>
       Expected:  The vendor card of the vendor identified by vendor id 001 should be updated to reflect the new name, "
       Jeremy Western Delivery". The result display shows the details of the vendor that has just been edited.

    1. Test case: `editvendor vid/`<br>
       Expected:  No vendor is edited. Error details shown in the result display.

    1. Other incorrect editvendor commands to try: `editvendor vid/001`, `editvendor n/Bing Massage Parlour`.<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

### Filter vendor

1. Filters vendors according to filter

    1. Test case: `filtervendor oh/5 0800`<br>
       Expected: Filters vendors that are open at 0800 and displays to the GUI

    2. Test case: `filtervendor oh/5 0800-1300`<br>
       Expected: Filters all vendors that operate anywhere between 0800 and 1300 on a Friday and displays them to the
       GUI

    3. Test case: `filtervendor sn/Food`<br>
       Expected: Filters all vendors that have a service name field of food.

### Show all vendors

1. Removes filters and switches to the vendor list

    1. Test case:

        1. Perform filter vendor example above

        2. Click on guest list

        3. `listvendor`<br>
           Expected: List will switch to vendor and removes filters

### Deleting a vendor

1. Deletes a vendor based on its vendor ID

    1. Test case: `deletevendor vid/123`<br>
       Expected: Deletes vendor with vid 123 from PH

### Clear vendor

1. Deletes all vendors from PH.

    1. Test case: `clearvendor`<br>
       Expected: Deletes all vendors from PH, vendor list will be empty.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   i. Test case: go to `data\addressbook.json` and corrupt the file. On bootup of the program, there should be a
   notification in the command box saying
   "File corrupted! Restored a new file." and the program will delete and load a fresh new file.

   ii. Rename `data\addressbook.json` to something else like `data\addressbook.json` would cause the addressbook to be
   not found and load the sample contacts into the addressbook.

## **Appendix C: Effort**

### Challenges faced

Prior to the 1.3b iteration, **PH** was aimed at managing **Guests** and **Staff**. However, upon meeting with our
CS2101 lecturer, we realised that our use cases were ill-defined and we had failed to adequately address the needs of
our target audience. Coming up with meaningful use cases for that iteration was difficult and our team gathered to
brainstorm ideas on what core features we should include and who our target audience should really be. We eventually
came to a consensus that our application would be front desk oriented and ended up redesigning the entire workflow of
the application. Instead of managing Guests and Staff, our app would now manage guests and external vendors, with a
focus on streamlining all guest-related processes such as check in, checkout, charging guests etc. That was one of the
longest meetings spanning over 5 hours as we cleared out most of the edge case scenarios and came up with features that
would be useful to the application.

With 5 days left to the submission deadline, we set out to achieve what most groups would take 4 weeks to do. We had to
make significant changes to refactor the original codebase. Our original commands such as `edit`, `add` (which was
converted to `checkin` and `returncheckin`) and `delete` had to be duplicated for both guests and vendors, which greatly
increased the workload for implementation and testing. Additionally, we made changes to the original `Model` by
introducing an `Archive`, which would be used to store checked out guests and implemented several new features that were
dissimilar to any of those in **AB3**, such as invoice generation for guests who engaged vendor services during their
stay. We also have more json files to manage such as `guests.json`, `vendors.json` and `archive.json`, which increased
the amount of testing and implementation required.

In particular, with the additional feature of generating invoices, we have a new workflow to allow this functionality
with the added logic for charging guests and checking out a guest for a smoother process. The parsing of the information
and generation of the layout was also tricky.

Two major entities are involved: `Guest` and `Vendor`:
The two classes have some fields in common but are different from one another. For example, Vendors have operating hours
while Guests have a list of things that they are charged for.

The difference in workflow also greatly increases the workload of implementation and testing for both the Guest and
Vendors due to the separate command logic and storage required to handle them.

### Achievements

We managed to revamp our existing v1.3 iteration to a whole new **PH** in v1.3b iteration within a week with all the new
features added such as filter, archive, invoice, chargeable, and returning guest check in.

Our team managed to deliver a convincing pitch and demo of our product and both our CS2101 lecturer and CS2103T tutor
were impressed with our work.
