### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is
responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete Milk c/5`.

![Delete Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

![Component Managers](images/ComponentManagers.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Displayable` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component
The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![Logic class diagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g. `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an item).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned by `Logic` back to the caller.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete Milk c/5` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div class="code-example bg-grey-lt-000">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

![Parser_Classes](images/ParserClasses.png)

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g. `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g. `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g. `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![Model class diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component:

- stores an `Inventory` object that encapsulates the inventory data.
- stores an optional `Order` object that encapsulates the current order data.
- stores a `TransactionList` object that encapsulates the history of past transactions.
- stores a `UserPref` object that encapsulates the user’s preferences.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the Model represents data entities of the domain, they should
  make sense on their own without depending on other components)

- The `Model` component interacts with `Ui` component through a `Displayable` interface.

![Model Low Level class diagram](images/ModelLowLevelClassDiagram.png)

Lower level details of `Model` component:

- `Inventory` and `Order` are each consists of an `UniqueItemList` which contains `Items`.
- The `TransactionList` stores `TransactionRecord` which are the records of history orders.
- Each `TransactionRecord` has a unique id and timestamp, with a list of `Item` transacted in the history order.

### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![Storage class diagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component's responsibility is to read and write persistent data. 
It can save inventory data, user preference data, bookkeeping data, and transaction history in json format, 
and read them back into corresponding objects.

The storage of different aspects of BogoBogo's data are each managed by their own class:

* Inventory Data: `JsonInventoryStorage` 
* User Preferences: `JsonUserPrefStorage`
* BookKeeping Data: `JsonBookKeepingStorage`
* Transaction History: `JsonTransactionStorage`

Each of these classes employ a facade interface that `Storage` inherits from. 
This ensures that `Storage` will have the necessary API for `Logic` to call when it wishes to save BogoBogo's state.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Ordering

When ModelManager is initialised, optionalOrder is set to Optional.empty(). At this point, the user has 1 order record
with 2 items in his transaction list.

![Initial_State](images/OrderInitialState.png)

Step 1. The user enters ordering mode via the `sorder` command.

Upon entering the ordering mode, optionalOrder now has a new Order() which is empty.

![Sorder_State](images/OrderSorderState.png)

Step 2. The user adds an item to the order via the `iorder` command.

Upon entering `iorder Banana c/1`, the order now contains 1 banana item.

![Iorder_State](images/OrderItem1State.png)

Next, upon entering `iorder Strawberry c/1`, the order now contains 1 strawberry item.

![Iorder_State](images/OrderItem2State.png)

Step 3. The user transacts and ends the order via the `eorder` command.

After the transaction is done, optionalOrder is reinitialised to Optional.empty().

![Initial_State](images/OrderFinalState.png)

Step 4. The new transactions are saved to the json file.

![Transact_Order_Sequence_Diagram](images/TransactOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

### Mutating Inventory

This section explains how various commands update the list of items in the inventory and display the result.

As described in the UML diagram of the Model component above, `Inventory` contains a `UniqueItemList` object which in turn
has `Item` objects. Every time add, remove, edit, delete, or clear is called, the `UniqueItemList` inside Inventory is
mutated, after which the UI will be changed upon the call of a method that mutates the `DisplayList` field inside
`ModelManager` such as `UpdateFilteredItemList()`. More specifically, the `ObservableList<Displayable>` inside the
`DisplayList` class is mutated.

The following sequence diagram shows what happens upon an addition of item to inventory until the 
`ObservableList<Displayable>` inside DisplayList changes.

<<<<<<< HEAD
**`EditCommand:`**       
EditCommand#execute() -> Model#setItem() -> Inventory#setItem() -> UniqueItemList#setItem() -> ObservableList<Item>

# set()
=======
![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)
>>>>>>> master

Another design decision that we have done is that `Item` objects are strictly immutable, as seen by all the
final fields. Thus, when any field is mutated, the previous `Item` is destroyed and a new `Item` is created. The
following activity diagram shows some possible actions that a user might take. Take note also on the difference
between Remove and Delete command.

<<<<<<< HEAD
**`DeleteCommand:`**      
DeleteCommand#execute() -> Model#deleteItem() -> Inventory#deleteItems() -> UniqueItemList#removeItem() ->
ObservableList<Item>#remove()

**`SortCommand:`**      
SortCommand#execute() -> Model#sortItem() -> Inventory#sortItems() -> UniqueItemList#sortItem() -> ObservableList<Item>

# sort()

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect:**

* **Finding Multiple Names, Ids or Tags:** The FindCommand supports finding by multiple names, ids or tags.
  `IdContainsNumberPredicate`, `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` takes in a list of
  strings which allows storing of multiple predicates. The items in the list are then matched with each predicate to
  update the filtered list. Thus, the displayed list contains items that matches multiple predicates given.
=======
![MutatingInventoryActivityDiagram](images/MutatingInventoryActivityDiagram.png)
>>>>>>> master

### Controlling the Display Panel in UI

The main panel of displayed items in the UI is managed by `DisplayListPanel` in the UI component. 
This panel is dependent on changes made by command logic and should be able to be toggled to display different lists. 
(e.g. inventory items, items in current order, list of transactions, etc.).

To minimise coupling between the logic and UI component, `DisplayListPanel` adopts an **observer pattern**.

![DisplayList1](images/ObserverPattern.png)

`DisplayListPanel` observes an `ObservableList<Displayable>` which is controlled by a `DisplayList` in the model component.
This way, any changes to model can be propagated to the ui without having to explicitly have knowledge about the ui component.

`DisplayList` is composed of 3 lists.
1. `DisplayList#filtered` —  A filtered list that is observed by `DisplayListPanel`.
2. `DisplayList#displayed` —  An observable list that acts as the base for `DisplayList#filtered`. 
Observes the current `DisplayList#source`.
3. `DisplayList#source` —  An observable list that acts as the base for `DisplayList#displayed`.

To propagate any changes to the filtered list, to be reflected to the ui, `DisplayList` can:

1. **Filter the displayed list**. 

Set a predicate on the filtered list. This is done when items to be displayed already exists in `DisplayList#source`.

2. **Mutate the displayed list**.

When the source is edited outside `DisplayList`, it will notify `DisplayList#displayed`, which will then copy and reflect all changes.
This, resultantly updates the `DisplayList#filtered` and the display panel.

3. **Update the source**.

Call `DisplayList#setItems` which takes in an observable list of items as a new source. 
`DisplayList` removes the listener from the previous source and adds a new listener to the new source.
It also updates `DisplayList#displayed` to reflect the new source.
This is done when we want to switch between lists to display. (e.g. displaying transactions instead of inventory)

<div class="code-example bg-grey-lt-000">:information_source:
<code>DisplayList</code> uses a 3 list approach because of the way JavaFX has implemented `FilteredList`.
`FilteredList` is bound to a `ObservableList` which is bound to a regular `List`. 
</div>

### Displaying an object

Any object can be displayed in the display panel by implementing the `Displayable` interface. 
The object must implement `Displayable#asDisplayCard()` which should return a `UIPart<Region>` that will act as the object's list cell.

![DisplayList3](images/ModelDisplayableClassDiagram.png)

### Design Considerations

**Time complexity**

Each update to source requires DisplayList to copy over an entire list (complexity: _O(n)_).
This is definitely inefficient since updates usually involve appending or removing an item from source.
(e.g. when the user adds an item to the inventory).

This inefficiency does not create observable latency given the envisioned scale of BogoBogo (1000 items).
However, if BogoBogo is to be scaled up in the future, there might be a need for a more advanced implementation.

Proposed upgrade: 
Instead of relying on JavaFX's `ObservableList`, we can create a customised observable list that can reference multiple sources.
From there, we should be able to toggle which source we want to be displaying on the `filteredlist`. This way, copying is no longer required.

### [Proposed Feature] Autocompleting commands

BogoBogo is optimised for users that prefer the speed of CLI-based applications. 
The application will be more attractive to typists if there is an autocompleting feature.
With the feature, the user doesn't need to type entire command keywords or product names.

```
System: BogoBogo
Sugggested Use Case —  Autocompleting a command
Actor: User
MSS:
  1. User types half a command.
  2. User requests for BogoBogo to autocomplete the command.
  3. BogoBogo suggests to the user a complete command.
     Step 2 - 3 is repeated until User finds the intended command.
  4. User submits the autocompleted command.
  5. BogoBogo processes the command.

Extensions:
  2a. BogoBogo cannot guess the user's command.
    2a1. BogoBogo notifies the user it cannot autocomplete the command.
    2a2. User enters the entire command.
         Use case resumes from step 5.
```

*Lower level details*{: .text-purple-000 }

Autocompletion can be facilitated by a `Wordbank` class which contains:
* A trie for command keywords
* A trie for existing item names.

A `CompleteCommand` can then query `Wordbank` to complete either a command keyword or item name. 
`Wordbank` also has to be updated when the user adds or removes a unique item name.

![WordbankUML](images/WordbankUML.png)

*Higher level details*{: .text-purple-000 }

BogoBogo will have 2 different ways to react to a command.

![AutocompleteActivityDiagram](images/AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png)

1. The user hits the `enter` key: the command is processed normally.
2. The user hits the `tab` key: the command is autocompleted.

For the ui to distinguish the 2, we will need to implement a `CommandSuggestion` class that extends `CommandResult`.
Should `CommandBox` detect a `CommandSuggestion` class when executing a command, it will adopt the suggestion stored in the result.

Here's an example of how BogoBogo can react to the command text "add noo" followed by the user hitting the `tab` character.
![AutocompleteSequenceDiagram](images/AutocompleteSequenceDiagram.png)

### Design considerations

BogoBogo adopts an [MVC pattern](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/designPatterns.html#model-view-controller-mvc-pattern). 
By utilising a `CommandSuggestion` class to store the autocompleted command, the partition between view and controller is retained.

Alternatively, `CommandBox` can give `Logic` a callback to edit its text field. 
However, implementing auxiliary methods to support the callback pattern will likely require more effort.
