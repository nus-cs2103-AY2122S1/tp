### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: More execution sequence can be found in the [Implementation](#implementation) section.
</div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("find attribute")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find attribute` Command](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram. The same disclaimer applies to subsequent activity diagrams in this document.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Datetime for Visit and LastVisit

#### Implementation details

Static class `DateTimeUtil` uses the library `java.time.LocalDateTime` and `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` to handle all datetime-related parsing and operations for `Visit` and `LastVisit` timings.
The datetime is stored and displayed differently in the system for both efficiency and readability:

- It is stored as `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` in the system and for parsing of commands.
- It is displayed as `dd LLL yyyy HH:mm` on the GUI.

For example, time at two o'clock in the afternoon of 1st November 2021 will be stored or parsed as `2021-11-01 14:00` and displayed as `01 Nov 2021 14:00`.


### Command warning

#### Implementation

Class `CommandWarning` stores warning details for a command executed. `CommandResult` class has a composition association with `CommandWarning` class. A `CommandWarning` is an optional field of a `CommandResult` instance:

![CommandWarningClassDiagram](images/CommandWarningClassDiagram.png)


There are two types of command warnings:

- `FUTURE_LAST_VISIT_WARNING`, when the user executes a command that updates a `LastVisit` field to a future datetime.
- `PAST_NEXT_VISIT_WARNING`, when the user executes a command that updates a `Visit` field to a past datetime.

When a warning is present, it affects the command result's displayed text and colour on the GUI.


### Add command

#### Implementation details

The add command is used to add an elderly to SeniorLove.
It makes use of polymorphism and interfaces, and is similar in implementation to other commands in SeniorLove:

- `AddCommand` extends `Command`
- `AddCommandParser` implements `Parser<AddCommand>`

The following activity diagram illustrates the activity flow of the add command:

<img src="images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="400" />

The following sequence diagram illustrates how different components of SeniorLove interact with each other:

![VisitSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario:

1. User inputs the add command, specifying the name, phone number, address and preferred language of the elderly to be added. They may also optionally include their health conditions, last visit, and the next scheduled visit.
2. After successfully parsing the user input, the `AddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.
3. The elderly that the user wants to add will be stored.
4. Upon successfully adding the elderly to address book, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design choices

- Optional last visit and visit attributes

  Both attributes are implemented as optional to allow users the flexibility to either add them on-the-go or omit them.

### Visit command

#### Implementation details

The visit command is used to add a visit to an existing elderly in SeniorLove.
It makes use of polymorphism and interfaces, and is similar in implementation to other commands in SeniorLove:

- `VisitCommand` extends `Command`
- `VisitCommandParser` implements `Parser<VisitCommand>`

The following activity diagram illustrates the activity flow of the visit command:

![VisitCommandActivityDiagram](images/VisitCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram illustrates how different components of SeniorLove interact with each other when a visit with a visitation frequency and number of occurrence specified is called:

![VisitSequenceDiagram](images/VisitSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario:

1. User inputs the visit command, specifying the index of the elderly to visit and the datetime at which they will go for the visit. They may also optionally include the visitation frequency and number of occurrences at this specified frequency.
2. After successfully parsing the user input, the `VisitCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.
3. The visit that the user wants to add to the elderly will be stored, and it will be converted into a separate format for displaying on the GUI.
4. Upon successfully adding the visit to the corresponding elderly, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design choices

- Overloading `edit` to add/change visit:

  The `visit` command is similar to the `edit` command in the sense that they both alter the elderly's attributes, and it is possible to implement similar functionality without a new command.
  However, we chose to implement the `visit` command since a visit can be added without having any visit previously, and overloading the `edit` command can make it confusing to use.

- Replacing the existing elderly with a new instance with the visit changed:

  We want to keep the data safe by ensuring immutability of Person objects. Therefore, we create an instance of Person with modified visit to replace the previous Person object.

- Implementing recurring visits with an occurrence counter and frequency attribute:

  Both methods can achieve the intended effect of implementing the recurring visits. However, we chose to go with an occurrence counter and frequency attribute because it requires less resources.
  We were concerned that the recurring visits could have many occurrences and at a high frequency, and this could lead to extra overhead in storing and accessing these arrays.

### Delete command

#### Implementation details

Delete command is used to delete an existing elderly or the next visit of an elderly in SeniorLove. It makes use of polymorphism and is similar to the other commands in SeniorLove:

- `DeleteCommand` extends `Command`
- `DeleteCommandParser` implements `Parser<DeleteCommand>`

The following activity diagram illustrates the activity flow of the delete command:

<img src="images/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

The following sequence diagram illustrate how the components interact with each other:

![DeleteSequenceDiagram2](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram2.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario:

1. User inputs the delete command, specifying the visit flag and the index of the elderly to be removed visit from. (If user wants to remove the entry of the elderly entirely instead of only removing the visit, she/he only needs to specify the index without the visit flag.)
2. After successfully parsing the user input, the `DeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.
3. The elderly which the user wants to delete visit from will be replaced by a new entry of a copy of elderly without the existing next visit.
4. Upon successfully deleting the visit from the corresponding elderly, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design choices

- Overloading `delete` to remove visit:

  Deleting elderly and deleting visits are overlapping functionalities dealing with removing information. It is possible to overload the `delete` command to achieve both functionalities without creating new command.

- Replace the existing elderly with a new instance (if deleting a visit):

  We want to keep the data safe by ensuring immutability of Person objects. Therefore, we create an instance of Person with visit removed to replace the previous Person object.

### Done command

#### Implementation details

The done command is used to mark an elderly's next visit as done, and update the elderly's `LastVisit` datetime value with that of the completed `Visit`.
The `Visit` field will also be updated or deleted depending on the `Occurrence` field's value.
It makes use of polymorphism and interfaces, and is similar in implementation to other commands in SeniorLove:

- `DoneCommand` extends `Command`
- `DoneCommandParser` implements `Parser<DoneCommand>`

The following activity diagram illustrates the activity flow of the done command:

<img src="images/DoneCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

The following sequence diagram shows how different components of SeniorLove interact with each other 
when executing a done command where the next visit is present for the elderly specified by the index:

![DoneSequenceDiagram](images/DoneCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design choices

- Overloading `edit` to change elderly:

  The `done` command makes use of the `edit` command to get a new copy of the `Person` object with the `Visit` and `LastVisit` fields being updated.

- Defensive Programming used:

  Execution of the `done` command makes use of defensive programming techniques to handle situations where `Visit` or its related `Frequency` and `Occurrence` fields are empty.

### Find command

#### Implementation details

The find command carries out a AND search on the attributes of all elderly in SeniorLove, and shows a list of elderly who match the find parameters. The find parameters are strings that are non-empty.

It makes use of polymorphism and interfaces, and is similar in implementation to other commands in SeniorLove:

- `FindCommand` extends `Command`
- `FindCommandParser` implements `Parser<FindCommand>`

The following activity diagram illustrates the activity flow of the visit command:

<img src="images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="350" />

The following sequence diagram shows how different components of SeniorLove interact with each other when executing a find command with a non-empty keyword:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario:

1. User inputs the find command, specifying the keyword(s) to find.
2. After successfully parsing the user input, the `FindCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.
3. Attributes of all elderly in the list are searched, and all elderly who satisfy the AND search will be returned.
4. `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design choices

- Searching by specified attributes:

  This is a possible solution, but we chose to do a search across all attributes because we have many flags and formatting, and it makes `find` harder to use if each attribute has to be specified.

- AND search:

  We chose to implement this over OR search because we want each new keyword to narrow the search space, so that it is easy to find elderly that match all the given attributes.

- Substring match:

  Matching by substring was implemented because it makes it easier to search for an elderly without having to remember their full attributes.

### Sort command

#### Implementation details

Sort command is used to sort the list of people in SeniorLove. visit of an elderly in SeniorLove. It makes use of polymorphism:

![SortCommandClassDiagram](images/SortCommandClassDiagram.png)

As shown in the class diagram above:

- `SortCommand` extends `Command`
- `SortCommandParser` implements `Parser<SortCommand>`

Given below is an example usage scenario:

1. User inputs the sort command, specifying the visit flag (or the last visit flag if user wants to sort by last visit.)
2. After successfully parsing the user input, the `SortCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called with the appropriate `SortComparator` and the sorting direction `isAscending`.
3. The current list of people will be sorted by the visit date from the earliest to the latest. (or sorted by the last visit date from the latest to the earliest).
4. Upon successfully sorting the visit of the corresponding elderly, a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design choices

- Wrapping the `FilteredList` around a `SortedList`:

  We choose to add a wrapper for list of elderly so that the original FilteredList remains immutable.

- Implementing `SortComparator` class:

  Creating a class of `SortComparator` makes the `SortCommand` more extensible in the future if developers would like to sort the list of persons by other attributes.

### Summary command

#### Implementation details

The summary command displays the statistics of overdue visits, upcoming visits and recent last visits.

It makes use of polymorphism and is similar in implementation to other commands in SeniorLove:

- `SummaryCommand` extends `Command`

Given below is an example usage scenario:

1. User inputs the summary command.
2. The `SummaryCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.
3. Statistics of the relevant visits and last visits are calculated and returned on the main panel.
4. `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

### Download command

#### Implementation details

The download command takes the `data\addressbook.json` file and converts it to a CSV file, then downloads it onto a directory of the user's choice.

It makes use of polymorphism and is similar in implementation to other commands in SeniorLove:

- `DownloadCommand` extends `Command`

Given below is an example usage scenario:

1. User inputs the download command.
2. The `DownloadCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.
3. The user is prompted to select a directory to download the data to, and the data is downloaded onto the chosen directory.
4. `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design choices

- Converting JSON to CSV:

  While it is possible to simply export the `addressbook.json` file as a JSON file, we decided to reformat the JSON file as a CSV file because we thought it would be make the data more readable. The JSON file formats elderly information in a way that is easier to query, and organises them by elderly. Converting to a CSV file allows us to display separate data fields as their own columns, making it easier to read.


### List command

#### Implementation details

The list command displays a list of either all elderly in SeniorLove, or all the elderly with next visit in the incoming week or month depending on the flag .

It makes use of polymorphism and is similar in implementation to other commands in SeniorLove:

- `ListCommand` extends `Command`

Given below is an example usage scenario:

1. User inputs the list command, specifying the flag for listing all or the flag for listing those with visit in the next week or month.
2. After successfully parsing the user input, the `ListCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called with the appropriate `Predicate<Person>` applied for filtering.
3. The model list is filtered,and a `CommandResult` object is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Design choices

- Combine features of listing all and of listing elderly with incoming visits into one `list` command:

  We choose to combine these two similar and relevant features into one command for simplicity. Different and self-explanatory flags are used here to distinguish them.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

- social worker who has a need to manage a significant number of elderly contacts with limited or no family support, and contact them regularly to check on their well-being
- prefers desktop apps over other types
- can type fast
- prefers typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:
Since social workers need to contact many elderly every day, we created this app to help them easily avoid missing out on any elderly while reducing the hassle of manually checking the frequency of contacts for each elderly.

## **Appendix: Effort**

Given below is a summary of the effort our team put into this project.

### Visit, last visit and associated features

These features were challenging to develop as they affect existing commands and classes. While maintaining the functionality of existing features, we also had to ensure their extensibility and consistency.

E.g. We took into consideration the existing delete command while implementing the delete visit feature. Although a new `delete visit` command could be easier to implement, we chose to overload the existing delete elderly command with a `v/` flag to maintain OOP and also make our commands formats consistent.

### Download

The main difficulty in developing this feature was the conversion from JSON to CSV, which required effort to understand
documentations.

### Sort

This feature required an in-depth understanding of JavaFX features. It was also challenging to maintain OOP, in particular,
the immutability of the data had to be maintained while sorting the list.

### Summary

The challenging part in implementing this feature was its integration with the UI, as it required the changing of display
from the elderly list to a summary list.

### UI

A considerable amount of effort was spent on revamping the user interface to cater for our purpose.
We incorporated functional colors into the UI, which required careful integration of the UI and logic.
E.g. Highlighting person card with red colour if the next visit is overdue.
We also reorganised and adjusted the components, spacing and design for user-friendliness.
While these UI changes are less challenging, it takes up considerable time and effort to produce a satisfactory render.
