## **Introduction**

![Ui](images/ailurusLogo.png)

Ailurus is a **desktop application** designed to aid Organising Committees from the Computing Faculty in managing and accounting for their administrative concerns. It provides users with the ability to plan and manage events and tasks for their members. 

The Developer Guide seeks to provide detailed documentation for developers to set up their environment, and understand the architecture and the different components, as well as their implementations in various commands.
It also informs developers of the requirements and instructions for manual testing for Ailurus.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `mdel /m 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java).

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MemberListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Member`, `Event` and `Task` object residing in the `Model`.

The GUI reflects the entered events, members and tasks recorded in Ailurus. There are three main columns that reflect the `Event`, `Member` and `Task` objects that are residing in the `Model`. Directly adding or removing `Event`, `Member` or `Task` would update the `EventListPanel`, `MemberListPanel` and `TaskListPanel` to show their respective `EventListCard`, `MemberListCard` and `TaskListCard` respectively. Each of the `EventListCard`, `MemberListCard` and `TaskListCard` would display the fields under the corresponding `Event`, `Member` and `Task` objects as discussed under [Model Component](#model-component).

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `MaddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a member).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components for the `execute ("mdel /m 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Components for the `mdel /m 1` Command](images/member/MdelSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Member` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueMemberList` object), and all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores a `TaskList` reference that points to the `TaskList` object that contains all the `Task` objects of the currently 'selected' `Member` object (e.g. result of a `tlist` command).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Member`, `Event` and `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Member>`, `ObservableList<Event>` and `ObservableList<Task>` respectively that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

Within the `Model` component,
* `Module` is the superclass of `Member`, `Event` and `Task`. `Module` has a `name` field as the common attribute of its subclasses.
* `Event` has a `name` field, `eventDate` field, and a `particpants` field consisting of a map of members to their attendance to serve as a participant list with attendance.
* `Member` has its original fields from AB3 and an additional field of a `TaskList` to store all tasks assigned to the member.
* `Task` has a `name` field, `taskDeadline` field, and a `isDone` field to represent the completion status of the task.

An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model design is given below,

<img src="images/AlternativeModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

* `AddressBook` also stores all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object).
* Each `Member` object references `Task` object in the `UniqueTaskList`, instead of needing its own list of tasks.
However, this design has some issues in storage,
* Since Ailurus uses JSON files to store user data, JSON format members should at least store the unique identifier of each task the member had.
In our implementation, the unique identifier is `Name` and `TaskDeadline`, which are actually the main part of a `Task`.
* At the same time, JSON format member need to store the completion status of each referencing task.
* In all, implementing the storage of this member-task relation by using JSON file is likely to incur redundancy and error-prone, so we decided to use an easier implementation, which is the current one.

A better implementation of the alternative design may involve using Database Management System (DBMS) like PostgreSQL, a proposed entity relationship model diagram for the member-task relation is given here: [ER_diagram](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/docs/images/ER.png).


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component converts data from Ailurus to `JSON` format and back. It utilizes the `Jackson` library for this purpose.
Address book data is both saved and read from `./data/ailurus.json` while user preference data is from `./preferences.json`.
If the files and directories do not exist, they are created with sample data when the Ailurus application is launched.

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in `JSON` format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (only one) depending on which functionality is needed.
* depends on some classes such as `Member`, `Event` and `Task` in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model` thus depends on them to convert data to JSON format).

From the name of the classes(beginning with JsonAdapted), we can tell which class they are storing in `JSON` format. All of these data are stored
in the `JsonSerializableAddressBook`.

For Example,
* `JsonAdaptedTask` stores `Task` in `JSON` format.
* `JsonAdaptedEvent` stores `Event` in `JSON` format. 


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Workflow**

Here is the Activity Diagram for a User when choosing the module and command to interact with in Ailurus:

![Activity Diagram for User Commands](images/CommandActivityDiagram.png)

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### List members who attended event

This feature allows Ailurus users to list all members who have attended a particular event, identified by the event's `EVENT_INDEX` displayed in the current event list shown.

This feature can be accessed using `mlist` command with parameters `/e EVENT_INDEX` and `/att`. Once the user enters the command, the **Sequence Diagram** below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components for the `execute("mlist /e 1 /att")` API call.

![MlistSequenceDiagram](images/member/MlistSequenceDiagram.png)

After the `LogicManager` receives the new `MlistCommand` object, `MlistCommand` would call the appropriate commands from `Model` and `Event` to get the correct index of the event from the filtered event list, get the list of members who attended the specific event, and set the current event while updating the filtered member list, as shown below.

<img src="images/member/MlistExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" width = "600" />

### Add member to an event

This feature allows Ailurus users to add a list of members, identified by the members' `MEMBER_INDEX` displayed in the current member list shown, to a specific event, identified by the event's `EVENT_INDEX` displayed in the current event list shown.

This feature can be accessed using `emadd` command with parameters `/e EVENT_INDEX` and multiple `/m MEMBER_INDEX` to add multiple members to an event. Once the user enters the command, the **Sequence Diagram** below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components for the `execute("emadd /e 1 /m 1 /m 2")` API call.

![EmaddSequenceDiagram](images/event/EmaddSequenceDiagram.png)

After the `LogicManager` receives the new `EmaddCommand` object, `EmaddCommand` would call the appropriate commands from `Model` and `Event` to get the indices from the current filtered event and member list, and add the members to be added in the event as shown below.

<img src="images/event/EmaddExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" width = "600" />

### Add event to Event List
This feature allows the user to add an event with a name, date and the participating members if any. Members to be
included have their `MEMBER_INDEX` displayed in the currently shown member list.

This feature can be accessed by using `eadd` command with parameters of
* `/n NAME`: the name of the event to add.
* `/d DATE`: the date of the event to add.
* zero to multiple uses of `/m MEMBER_INDEX`: target member identified by the index displayed in the currently shown member list.

Given below is the sequence diagram when a user provides a valid `eadd` command: `eadd /n Chess Competition /d 11/12/2022 /m 1 /m 2` to add a new event with its name, date and the first and second member displayed in the currently shown member list as the members for this event.

![EventAddSequenceDiagram](images/event/EventAddSequenceDiagram.png)

As seen in the diagram above, once the user entered the `eadd` command,
the `Logic` component will parse the parameters, creating an `EaddCommandParser`. This parser will proceed to 
create an `Event` object based on the parameters and a `EaddCommand` object afterwards.

The diagram below shows the execution of `EaddCommand` after `LogicManager` receives the `EaddCommand` object. 

<img src="images/event/EventAddExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" width = "600" />

As seen in the diagram above,
1. `LogicManager` will call the `execute` method of `EaddCommand`.
2. `EaddCommand` will call `Model#getFilteredMemberList` to get the last shown member list.
3. `EaddCommand` will call `Model#addParticipants(membersToBeAdded)` to add the members indicated in the parameters to the event.
4. `EaddCommand` will call `Model#hasEvent(event)`, throwing an error if the model already has that event.
5. If not,`EaddCommand` will call `Model#addEvent(event)` to add that event to the model.
6. `EaddCommand` will then create a `CommandResult` object and return it to `LogicManager`.

* <u>Design Decision</u>: Instead of only allowing adding of events and not adding participants, eadd command allows creation of complete events with multiple participants to minimise commands required to add them individually. The format is similar to `mdel` and `mlist` commands for familiarity with similar commands for other modules.

### Mark event members as attended
This feature allows the user to mark members of the event as attended. Include which members to mark based on `MEMBER_INDEX` displayed in the currently shown member list. Only valid members belonging to the event will be able to be marked, with an error being thrown if there is an invalid member. It is recommended to filter the member list to those of the event involved in the command through the `mlist /e EVENT_INDEX` command.

This feature can be accessed by using `emark` command with parameters of
* `/e EVENT_INDEX`: target event identified by the index displayed in the currently shown event list.
* multiple uses of `/m MEMBER_INDEX`: target member identified by the index displayed in the currently shown member list.

Given below is the sequence diagram when a user provides a valid `emark` command: `emark /e 1 /m 2 /m 4` to mark the two members provided as having attended the event. It is shown in the GUI with their member labels in the designated event card shown as green.

![EventMarkSequenceDiagram](images/event/EventMarkSequenceDiagram.png)

As seen in the diagram above, once the user entered the `emark` command,
the `Logic` component will parse the parameters, creating an `EmarkCommandParser`. This parser will proceed to create an `EmarkCommand` object afterwards.

The diagram below shows the execution of `EmarkCommand` after `LogicManager` receives the `EmarkCommand` object.

<img src="images/event/EventMarkExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" width = "600" />

As seen in the diagram above,
1. `LogicManager` will call the `execute` method of `EmarkCommand`.
2. `EmarkCommand` will call `Model#getFilteredEventList` to get the last shown event list.
2. `EmarkCommand` will call `Model#getFilteredMemberList` to get the last shown member list.
5. If not,`EmarkCommand` will call `Event#markAttendance(members)` for the selected event to mark the members.
6. `EmarkCommand` will then create a `CommandResult` object and return it to `LogicManager`.


### Task add command: `tadd`
This feature allows Ailurus users to add a new task for multiple members identified by their `MEMBER_INDEX` displayed in the currently shown member list.

This feature can be accessed by using `tadd` command with parameters of
* `/n NAME`: the name of the task to add.
* `/d DATE_TIME`: the deadline of the task to add.
* multiple `/m MEMBER_INDEX`: multiple target members identified by the index displayed in the currently shown member list.

Given below is the sequence diagram when a user provides a valid `tadd` command: `tadd /n meeting /d 11/11/2021 20:00 /m 1 /m 2` to add a new task with its name and deadline to the first and second member displayed in the currently shown member list.

![TaskAddSequenceDiagram](images/task/TaskAddSequenceDiagram.png)

As seen in the diagram above, once the user entered the `tadd` command,
the `Logic` component will parse the parameters and create a `Task` object based on the parameters and a `TaddCommand` object.

<img src="images/task/TaskAddExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" width = "600" />

After `LogicManager` receives the `TaddCommand` object, 
1. `LogicManager` will call the `execute` method of `TaddCommand`.
2. `TaddCommand` will call `Model#getFilteredMemberList` to get the last shown member list.
3. `TaddCommand` will get the list of target members based on the `MEMBER_INDEX` list and the last shown member list.
4. `TaddCommand` will call `Model#addTask(targetMember, taskToAdd)` to add the new task to each target member .
5. `TaddCommand` will create a `CommandResult` object and return it to `LogicManager`.

### Mark a task as done command: `tdone`
This feature allows Ailurus users to mark multiple tasks as done. These tasks are identified by their `TASK_INDEX` displayed in the currently shown task list.

This feature can be accessed by using `tdone` command with multiple `/t TASK_INDEX` parameters.

Given below is the sequence diagram when a user provides a valid `tdone` command: `tdone /t 1 /t 2` to mark the first and second tasks in the task list as done.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The diagram below does not include the details of the construction of `TdoneCommand` object, because its implementation is similar to the construction of `TaddCommand` shown in the previous example.

</div>

<img src="images/task/TaskDoneSequenceDiagram.png" width = "600" />

After `LogicManager` receives the `TdoneCommand` object,
1. `LogicManager` will call the `execute` method of `TdonedCommand`.
2. `TdoneCommand` will call `Model#getFilteredTaskList` to get the last shown task list.
3. `TdoneCommand` will get the list of target tasks based on the `TASK_INDEX` list and the last shown task list.
4. `TdoneCommand` will construct a completed `Task` object based on each target task.
5. `TdoneCommand` will call `Model#setTask(targetTask, completedTask)` to set each original target task to a completed task.
6. `TdoneCommand` will create a `CommandResult` object and return it to `LogicManager`.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `mdel /m 5` command to delete the 5th member in the address book. The `mdel` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `mdel /m 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `madd /n David â€¦â€‹` to add a new member. The `madd` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the member was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `mlist`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `mlist`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. 
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `mdel`, just save the member being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files.

   1. Test case: Add invalid characters such as `@` to the file, such as after any `{` character.
   Expected: Ailurus launches with no data.
   Solution: remove data file and restart ailurus application.

## **Appendix: Effort**

Overall, the team felt that this project was moderately difficult, due to the lack of experience in [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) library and managing a codebase that was larger than expected. Most of the features added were `CRUD` (Create, Read, Update, Delete) related, with exceptions to find and filtering features in `tlist` and `mlist` commands, as well as marking commands.

### Challenges faced

The difficulty lies in the increased complexity of the application as it grows. While the original `Addressbook-level-3 (AB3)` only handles one module, which is the `Person` module, we refactored it to `Member` and added 2 more layers of complexity to it: the `Task` and the `Event` modules, which all inherit from a generic `Module` class. As such, we had to deal with more interactions between the modules, such as in listing all members in an event, or listing all overdue tasks of a member, and so on. Also, we had to update the state of the JavaFX UI constantly with each change in state. Hence, there is a need to monitor the communications between the `Logic`, `Model` and `UI` APIs to allow smooth transitions and updating of `FilteredList<T>` passed to the UI, and it would not be easy to do so if we only display one screen at a time. As our JavaFX knowledge was limited, we decided to go with 3 columns showing `Event`, `Members` and `Tasks`. [This was our Mockup UI for illustration](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t15-2.github.io/tp/images/UImockup.png).

We also faced difficulties in deciding our architecture for our `Model` component, as we had different iterations of possible UML class diagram of the proposed `Model` component ([overview idea](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t15-2.github.io/tp/images/modeloverview.png), [v1](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t15-2.github.io/tp/images/modelv1.png), [v2](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t15-2.github.io/tp/images/modelv2.png), [final version](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t15-2.github.io/tp/images/ModelClassDiagram.png)). At first, there was the idea that events have multiple members, but members should also have many events, and therefore they could have a many-to-many relationship. However, we realised that this was not a trivial case, as our storage uses JSON objects, which in itself is limited as it is unlike relational databases like [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). Therefore, having no foreign keys in such a database requires a lot of duplication of data, which we felt was unnecessary considering the simplicity of our product, hence we decided not to go forth with the idea.

### Achievements in the project

* To implement the 3 columns for `Event List`, `Member List` and `Task List`, we had to learn about [SplitPane](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/SplitPane.html) and made it such that the positions are approximately a third of the whole size and that the columns are resizable to a certain degree.

* We also learnt about the property of `textwrap` to allow larger words and names to be stored and shown. The `textwrap` property also allows dynamic text wrapping with different width of the column, to ensure that the data is fully visible by the user.

* The `CRUD` commands for `Event`, `Member` and `Task` were mostly referred from AB3â€™s `Person` commands and classes. However, some fields were created and tested by the team, such as the use of `LocalDateTime` and `LocalDate` from the Java library for `Event` and `Task` respectively, to capture the date and time parsed as string by user.

* We increased user experience by color coding the tasks of members and members of events with red and green, red being undone tasks or absent members, while green being done tasks or present members who attended the event.

* We realised the power of using streams to handle sets of data. The use of streams is especially useful in the case of deciding how the labels (e.g. `Member` in `Event List`, `Task` in `Member List`) will appear in `FlowPane`.

* We enforced commands to require a space between the prefix and the parameter, to allow easier readability of parameter, and it is also more intuitive to use `/prefix` commands with `/` before the prefix, similar to chat-bots and UNIX commands usually have the symbol before the flag or prefix.

* We showed the number of members / tasks / events listed for most listing and finding command, except those commands which show the full list.

* We customized our UI to produce blue highlighting of cards if you click on them for selecting of a specific card if the list gets very long.
