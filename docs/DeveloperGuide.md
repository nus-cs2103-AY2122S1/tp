### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/safeforhall/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/safeforhall/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/safeforhall/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="700"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/safeforhall/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/safeforhall/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/safeforhall/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="1100" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` or `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` or `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/safeforhall/storage/Storage.java)

![StorageClassDiagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `safeforhall.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Command

This command allows the user to add residents or events to the SafeFor(H)All application depending on the currently active tab.

The workflow of the Add command is shown in the Activity diagram illustrated below.

![AddActivityDiagram](images/logic/commands/addcommand/AddActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Optional `LastDate` fields when adding residents**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `lastFetDate` and `lastCollectionDate` are optional fields
  * Pros:
    - Provides more flexibility for users when adding residents to the application, as users have the choice to include or exclude these fields.
    - Saves time as all fields can be added in a single command
  * Cons: The length of command is increased as there are potentially more fields for the user to type.

* **Alternative 2:** Add `lastFetDate` and `lastCollectionDate` by editing the Person object
  * Pros: Makes add command more user-friendly as the command is more succinct
  * Cons: User has to go through a two-step process of `add` and `edit` to initialise a residents information

### Delete Command

This command allows the user to delete residents or events to the SafeFor(H)All application depending on the currently active tab.

The workflow of the Delete command is shown in the Activity diagram illustrated below.

![AddActivityDiagram](images/logic/commands/deletecommand/DeleteActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Delete the correct resident/event:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Index` field
    * Pros: No need to type out the full name of the resident/event, and risk typos. `Index` is also unique, which prevents the user
      from deleting the wrong resident/event.
    * Cons: The user needs to scroll through the GUI to find the index of the resident/event to be deleted.

* **Alternative 2:** `Name` and `eventName` fields for Resident and Event respectively.
    * Pros: The user does not need to scroll through the GUI to find the index of the resident/event to be deleted.
    * Cons: There is a higher risk of erroneous user input, as a `Name`/`eventName` field will inevitably be longer than
      an index.


### Edit Command

This command allows the user to edit residents or events to the SafeFor(H)All application depending on the currently active tab.

The workflow of `EditPersonCommand` is shown in the Activity diagram illustrated below.

![EditActivityDiagram](images/logic/commands/editcommand/EditActivityDiagram.png)
`EditEventCommand` follows a similar flow of actions.

Note:
- Mass operations for residents can be carried out by inputting multiple indexes after the command `edit`, each separated by a whitespace.
- `Residents` field in `Event` is not editable by `edit` command

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Edit parameters:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Excluding `Residents` parameter for Events.
    * Pros:
        - Simpler implementation as there are less `EditDescriptors` to maintain.
        - `include` and `exclude` commands exist to enhance the updating of the `Residents` field.
          `edit` currently replaces the specified fields with the user input, which will not be user-friendly for the `Residents` field.
          It might also cause confusion of possible overlapping functionality on the user's side.
    * Cons: Increases the number of commands the user has to remember.

* **Alternative 2:** `edit` is used to edit the residents involved in an event
    * Pros: More instinctive, and less commands for the user to remember.
    * Cons: Users will have to rewrite the entire list of residents involved in the event whenever they want to modify the list of residents involved.


### View Command

This command allows the user to view the additional details of a specific resident or event in the sidebar, depending on the currently active tab.

How it works:
1. When the app is started, the `Ui` component calls on `Logic` to get the `Model` to be displayed in the sidebar. `Model` is first set to an empty list.
2. When a `ViewCommand` with a valid index is executed, the `Model` is updated to contain only the specified resident or event.
3. When the `ViewCommand` is executed without index parameters, the main panel will show all residents or events, and the sidebar will be cleared.
4. If the command is run in the `ResidentTab`, the details of the resident with the corresponding index being displayed in the sidebar. Vice versa for `EventTab`.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates what happens when the `ViewPersonCommand` is executed:

![ViewCommandSequenceDiagram](images/logic/commands/viewcommand/ViewPersonCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
`ViewEventCommand` follows a similar sequence of interactions.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to reference residents/ events in the CLI:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reference by `Index`.
    * Pros:
      - Easy to reference and no need to type out the whole `residentName`/ `eventName`.
      - `Index` is unique.
    * Cons: Need to first determine the `Index` of the resident/ event in the UI. `View` could become a two-step process if the database is large.

* **Alternative 2:** Reference by `residentName`/ `eventName`.
    * Pros: Do not have to first determine the `Index` of the resident/ event.
    * Cons:
      - Hard to type when the `residentName`/ `eventName` is long.
      - `eventName` is not unique, which might cause issues.


### Find Person Command

This command allows searching for residents subjected to 1 or more filters for the different available parameters.

The workflow of the Find Person command can be illustrated with an activity diagram as follows:

<img src="images/logic/commands/findcommand/FindActivityDiagram.png" width="900" />

How the parsing works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute the command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. If the command was run in the `ResidentTab` it results in a `FindCommandParser` object created and it's `parse` method called with the user input.
1. The parsing attempts to create a `FindCommand` object. For each existing prefix, it sets the relevant field of a new `FindCompositePredicate` object.
1. Parsing of any of the provided values can throw a `ParseException` if invalid. If at least one field is set, a `FindCommand` object is returned. If all are unspecified, an exception is thrown.
1. The command is executed and the result encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Note:
 - Name can take in multiple keywords separated by whitespace
 - `lastFetDate` and `lastCollectionDate` are not included
 - Room filtering is extended to allow block, level and block-level filtering as well


The following sequence diagram demonstrates what happens when the `FindCommand` is executed:

<img src="images/logic/commands/findcommand/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="900" />

The command extends the `Command` class and implements `FindCommand#execute()` to execute the command.

The crucial logic underlying is encapsulated in the `FindCompositePredicate` class. This class holds the filtering variables and constructs the required predicate for filtering. The `test` method creates and combines the predicates as shown:

```java
@Override
public boolean test(Person person) {
    List<Predicate<Person>> allPredicates = Arrays.asList(
        p -> getName().orElse(x -> true).test(p),
        p -> getRoom().orElse(x -> true).test(p),
        p -> getPhone().orElse(x -> true).test(p.getPhone()),
        p -> getEmail().orElse(x -> true).test(p.getEmail()),
        p -> getVaccStatus().orElse(x -> true).test(p.getVaccStatus()),
        p -> getFaculty().orElse(x -> true).test(p.getFaculty()));

    return allPredicates
            .stream()
            .reduce(p -> true, Predicate::and)
            .test(person);
}
```

Most variables are checked against using their respective `equals` methods except for `Name` and `Room` for which separate predicates implementing `Predicate<Person>` have been created. This is done to support:
1. Multiple keywords matching for name and 
2. Room matching by block, level and block-level.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Filtering parameters:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Excluding `lastFetDate` and `lastCollectionDate` parameters.
    * Pros:
        - Simpler implementation as there are less filtering predicates to maintain.
        - `list` command exists to enhance the usage of these 2 fields to extract information. A simple equality check on date is less likely from the user's POV and `list` handles this. Thus excluding this, prevents confusion of possible overlapping functionality on the user's side.
    * Cons:
        - The user is unable to search for an exact fet/collection date alongside other filters.


### Include Command

This command adds multiple residents to an event by referencing the `Event` by its `Index` and the `Person` to 
add by their `Name` or `Room` through the `AddressBook#findPerson()` method.

The following activity diagram illustrates how the `AddressBook#findPerson()` method works:

![FindPersonActivityDiagram](images/logic/commands/includecommand/FindPersonActivityDiagram.png)

The command extends the `Command` class and implements `IncludeCommand#execute()` to execute the command. 
A `ResidentList` which contains a list of `Person` to add to an `Event`, is a field added to an `Event`.

When `IncludeCommand#createEditedEvent()` is called, two methods of `Event` are invoked:
* `Event#getCombinedDisplayString()` creates a display String with just the names of each `Person` in the combination 
  of current `Person` in the Event` and all the `Person` in `toAdd` with no duplicate.
* `Event#getCombinedStorageString()` creates a storage String with the full information of each `Person` in the 
  combination of current `Person` in the Event` and all the `Person` in `toAdd` with no duplicate. 

The following sequence diagram demonstrates what happens when the `IncludeCommand` is executed:

![IncludeCommandSequenceDiagram](images/logic/commands/includecommand/IncludeCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `IncludeCommand` is executed:

![IncludeCommandActivityDiagram](images/logic/commands/includecommand/IncludeCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to reference event in the CLI:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reference by `Index`.
    * Pros: Easy to reference and no need to type out the whole `eventName`, `Index` is also unique.
    * Cons: Need to find the `Index` of the `Event` in the UI to know what `Index` the `Event` has if the number of `Event` is large.

* **Alternative 2:** Reference by `eventName`.
  itself.
    * Pros: Do not need to have the `Index` in UI to know what `Event` it is, can just reference it by its name.
    * Cons: Hard to type when the `eventName` is long, `eventName` not being unique will also cause issues.
