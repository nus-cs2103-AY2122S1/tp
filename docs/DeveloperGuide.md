## <a name="Architecture"></a> **4. Architecture**

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/programmer/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/programmer/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): ProgrammerError's UI.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of ProgrammerError in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

## <a name="UI component"></a> **5. UI component**

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/programmer/ui/Ui.java)

At a high level, the `MainWindow` component interacts with 3 other main components: `Logic`, `PopupManager` and `FileManager` (Figure 4.1).
Note that the components under `MainWindow` have been omitted for simplicity and will be shown in greater detail in the next diagram.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/ui/UiClassDiagramOverview.png)
<div style="text-align: center">
    <em>Figure 5.1: Overview of Ui components</em>
</div>
<br>
1. Firstly, `MainWindow` interacts with the `Logic` component to determine which data to display to the user.
2. Secondly, `MainWindow` conducts file operations on the Ui through a `FileManager`.
   For instance, the `FileManager` handles situations where the user is required to select files or directories.
3. Thirdly, to manage the display of popup windows to the user, `MainWindow` interacts with a `PopupManager` which handles
   the configuration, creation and showing of popups on the Ui.

In addition, there are two additional windows that the UI can display: `HelpWindow` and `DashboardWindow`. They inherit
from the abstract class `PopupWindow`, which captures the commonalities between classes that represent popup information
to be displayed to the user.

Now taking a closer look at the `MainWindow` component, it consists of a number of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. (Figure 5.2). These components, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI. The following is a summary of the parts of the `MainWindow`.

![Structure of the UI Component](images/ui/UiClassDiagramMainComponents.png)
<div style="text-align: center">
    <em>Figure 5.2: MainWindow Ui components</em>
</div>
<br>
Note that the `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework.

- The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
  For example, the layout of
  the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
  is specified
  in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

- The styling of the UI components are defined in the `src/main/resources/view/css` folder.

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

## <a name="Logic component"></a> **6. Logic component**

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![Logic Class Diagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ProgrammerErrorParser` class to parse the user
   command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/commands/DeleteCommand/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

![Parser Class](images/ParserClasses.png)

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ProgrammerErrorParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ProgrammerErrorParser` returns back
  as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

## <a name="Model component"></a> **7. Model component**

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/programmer/model/Model.java)

![Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)


The `Model` component,

* stores the ProgrammerError data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
  which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be
  bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in `ProgrammerError`, which `Student` references. This allows `ProgrammerError` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

## <a name="Storage component"></a> **8. Storage component**

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/programmer/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both ProgrammerError data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `ProgrammerErrorStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if
  only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

## <a name="Common classes"></a> **9. Common classes**

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.programmer.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <a name="Implementations"></a> **10. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedProgrammerError`. It extends `ProgrammerError` with an
undo/redo history, stored internally as an `programmerErrorStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it
implements the following operations:

* `VersionedProgrammerError#commit()` — Saves the current ProgrammerError state in its history.
* `VersionedProgrammerError#undo()` — Restores the previous ProgrammerError state from its history.
* `VersionedProgrammerError#redo()`
* ores a previously undone ProgrammerError state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitProgrammerError()`, `Model#undoProgrammerError()`
and `Model#redoProgrammerError()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedProgrammerError` will be initialized with the
initial ProgrammerErrorstate, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single ProgrammerError state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/commands/UndoCommand/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the ProgrammerError. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitProgrammerError()`, causing the modified state of the ProgrammerError after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `programmerErrorStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted ProgrammerError
state.


![UndoRedoState1](images/commands/UndoCommand/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add -n David …​` to add a new student. The `add` command also
calls `Model#commitProgrammerError()`, causing another modified ProgrammerError state to be saved into
the `programmerErrorStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/commands/UndoCommand/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitProgrammerError()`, so the ProgrammerError state will not be saved into the `programmerErrorStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoProgrammerError()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous ProgrammerError state, and restores the ProgrammerError to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/commands/UndoCommand/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ProgrammerError state, then there are no previous ProgrammerError states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoProgrammerError()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/commands/UndoCommand/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoProgrammerError()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the ProgrammerError to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `pProgrammerErrorStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest ProgrammerError state, then there are no undone ProgrammerError states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoProgrammerError()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the CS2100 TA rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The CS2100 TA then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the ProgrammerError, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitProgrammerError()`, `Model#undoProgrammerError()` or `Model#redoProgrammerError()`.
Thus, the `programmerErrorStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/commands/UndoCommand/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The CS2100 TA executes `purge`, which calls `Model#commitProgrammerError()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `programmerErrorStateList`, all ProgrammerError states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add -n David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/commands/UndoCommand/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a CS2100 TA executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ProgrammerError.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Add Student 
#### Implementation 

The add student feature allows the CS2100 to add a new student into the student list. Its implementation 
introduces the following classes: 

- `AddCommand` that extends `Command`
- `AddCommandParser` that implements `Parser<AddCommand>`
- Student information: `Student`, `Name`, `StudentId`, `ClassId`, `Email`, `UniqueStudentList` 

The syntax of this command is `add -n <NAME> -sid <STUDENT_ID> -cid <CLASS_ID> -email <EMAIL>`. For instance,
`add -n Erwin -sid A0234596H -cid B02 -email e0543221@u.nus.edu` will create a student with the given name, student id, 
class id and email. 

Given below is a possible usage scenario:

The CS2100 TA keys in the command `add -n Erwin -sid A0234596H -cid B02 -email e0543221@u.nus.edu`. 

The mechanism is as described below: 
- Upon detecting `add` as the command word. `ProgrammerErrorParser` will create a `AddCommandParser` with the input 
name, student id, class id and email. 
- `AddCommandParser` parses the name, student id, class id and email and creates a `Student` object. It will then 
create a `AddCommand` with the new `Student` object. 
- `AddCommand` receives the new `Student` object and checks if any student in `UniqueStudentList` shares the same `studentId` and `email`
with the newly created student. 
- If the new `Student` is unique it will be added to the `UniqueStudentList`. 
- ProgrammerError will show a success message for adding the student. For example, `New student added: Erwin; Student ID: A0234596H; Class ID: B02; Email: e0543221@u.nus.edu`
in the `resultDisplay`, informing the user that the add operation is valid. 


The following (partial) sequence diagram shows how the add command works:
- Note: toAdd in the sequence diagram represents the new `Student` object to be added.
- Refer to [Logic component](#Logic component) for a review of the Logic Component.


 ![AddCommandActivityDiagram](images/commands/AddCommand/AddCommandAbstractSequenceDiagram.png)


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a CS2100 TA executes a new command:
![AddCommandActivityDiagram](images/commands/AddCommand/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations: 

#### Aspect: Only unique Student ID and email is accepted: 
- Each student object should have unique Student ID and email. 
  - Pros: 
    - Ensures that each student is unique and easily identifiable with the key attributes.
    - Ensures that there are no duplicates and redundant data. 
  - Cons: 
    - The strict checks on the `UniqueStudentList` will affect `EditCommand` when the user tries to edit an existing student. 
    This will happen when the user only wants to edit one of the attribute. (For example, studentId.)
    This newly edited student will have an old copy of the email. This side effect will cause the newly created `student` to clash with its old instance in `UniqueStudentList`, 
    causing the command to fail, even though it should be valid. As such, it makes it hard to implement, as we have to 
    ensure that it works with `EditCommand` as well.

### Filter Student List

#### Implementation

The filter mechanism is facilitated by the `QueryStudentDescriptor` and the
`StudentDetailContainsQueryPredicate`. The `StudentDetailContainsQueryPredicate` extends `Predicate<Student>` and
contains a private field of type
`QueryStudentDescriptor` that will be used to test if a given student to the predicate matches all the query fields in
the `QueryStudentDescriptor`.

* `StudentDetailContainsQueryPredicate#test(Student)` — Evaluates the predicate on the given `Student` argument.
* `QueryStudentDescriptor#doesStudentMatchDescriptor(Student)` — Evaluates if the `QueryStudentDescriptor` fields
  matches with the corresponding fields of the `Student` argument.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate<Student>)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list filtering mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The CS2100 TA launches the application.

Step 2. The CS2100 TA executes `filter -cid B01` to display all the students whose Class ID matches `B01`.

The following UML sequence diagrams shows how the filter command works:

1. In the following sequence diagram, the focus is on modelling the interactions between components to create the `FilterCommand` object.
   
![FilterSequenceDiagramParse](images/commands/FilterCommand/FilterSequenceDiagramParse.png)

2. In the next sequence diagram, the focus is on the interactions between components when the `FilterCommand` is being executed.

![FilterSequenceDiagramExecute](images/commands/FilterCommand/FilterSequenceDiagramExecute.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `StudentDetailContainsPredicate`
, `QueryStudentDescriptor` and `FilterCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following UML activity diagram summarizes what happens when a CS2100 TA executes a new filter command.

![FilterActivityDiagrm](images/commands/FilterCommand/FilterActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration

**Aspect: How filter command executes**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filter commands can take in any combination of query parameters (`-n`, `-cid`, `-sid` and `-email`)
    * Pros: Allow for flexibility in the way the CS2100 TA wants to filter the list.
    * Cons: More difficult to implement and proper handling of the combinations of query parameters is needed.

* **Alternative 2:** A different type of filter command to filter by each of the student's attribute.
    * Pros: Implementation does not need to consider the combination of query parameters.
    * Cons: Multiple commands have to be executed to filter the list in more than one query dimension.

**Aspect: How to handle combination of query parameters**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Design a `QueryStudentDescriptor` class that abstracts the handling of the input
  query parameters.
    * Pros: Need not explicitly handle the different argument combinations at the higher-level abstractions
      (e.g. `FilterCommandParser` class). Code is more maintainable.
    * Cons: Was more difficult to implement which required time to design the interactions among the components.

* **Alternative 2:** Handle the different argument combinations in the `FilterCommandParser` class.
    * Pros: Easier to handle empty argument cases with explicit conditional checking.
    * Cons: Bad use of abstraction, SLAP violated and long nested conditional statements. Code made harder for future
      extension.

**Aspect: Naming the function**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calling it `filter`.
    * Pros: `filter` is an intuitive command word for the expected functionality.
    * Cons: From the user experience perspective, it is slightly longer than type than other alternative.

* **Alternative 2:** Calling it `view`.
    * Pros: It is shorter to type and less refactoring required from the code that this project evolved from.
    * Cons: `view` is not as intuitive as other alternatives.

* **Alternative 3 (future consideration):** Providing a shortcut command for `filter`.
    * Pros: Allows for users to type less for the same expected behaviour.
    * Cons: New users may be confused with such shortcut commands.

### Show Lab Results Feature

#### Implementation

The show lab results feature allows the CS2100 TA to view the lab result list of a particular student. Its
implementation introduces the following classes:

* `ShowCommand`that extends `Command`
* `ShowCommandParser` that implements `Parser<ShowCommand>`
* `ShowCommandResult` that extends `CommandResult`

The syntax of this command is `show <INDEX_IN_LIST>`. For instance,`show 1` asks ProgrammerError to display the lab
results of student at index 1 of the current list.

Given below is a possible usage scenario:

[Pre-Condition] There are 2 students in ProgrammerError, and the CS2100 TA has created some lab results for each of
them.

Step 1. The CS2100 TA keys in the command `show 1`: The information of the student at index 1 as well as his/her lab
results are displayed on the side panel.

The mechanism is as described below:

* Upon detecting 'show' as the command word. `ProgrammerErrorParser` will create a `ShowCommandParser` with the input
  index.


* `ShowCommandParser` parses the index and creates a `ShowCommand`, which finds the student to be shown according to the
  index and creates a `ShowCommandResult` with the student identified.


* `MainWindow` receives the `ShowCommandResult` and displays the information and lab results of the identified student.

Step 2. The CS2100 TA keys in `show 2`: The side panel is updated with the information and lab results of the student at
index 2

Step 3. The CS2100 TA key in `show 3`: ProgrammerError will show an error message in the `resultDisplay`, warning the
user that the index is invalid. This is triggered by `CommandException`, which is thrown by `ShowCommand`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the show command works:

![ShowSequenceDiagram](images/commands/ShowCommand/ShowSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a CS2100 TA executes a new command:

![ShowActivityDiagram](images/commands/ShowCommand/ShowActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How Show Lab Results executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each student object keeps track of its own lab results by an ObservableList.
    * Pros: Easy to implement; Lower chance of having mismatched student and lab records.
    * Cons: Have to pass a `Student` instance across different classes; May have performance issue if more attributes
      are added for `Student`

* **Alternative 2:** An ObservableList of lab results of every student in ProgrammerError itself.
    * Pros: Potential improvement in performance by passing an index, instead of a `Student` instance, across different
      classes.
    * Cons: Hard to implement, as we have to ensure the ObservableList of lab results and students have matching index
      (ie `Student` instance at index 1 of student list has its lab results at index 1 of lab results list), given that
      other operations such as add and delete can change the indexes easily.

### Download Data Feature

The download data feature allows the CS2100 TA to download student data as a CSV file in a directory location of their
choice.

#### Implementation

The implementation details of this feature can be found mainly in `MainWindow` as most of the necessary operations are
related to the UI. In addition, the following classes are utilised:

- `DownloadCommand`: for generating the `DownloadCommandResult`
- `DownloadCommandResult`: for displaying the feedback to the CS2100 TA
- `MainWindow.fxml`: for the addition of a 'Download' button on the MainWindow
- `Popup.css`: for the customisation of styles for pop-up messages

In the `Logic` components, the `download` command works in a similar fashion to the `show` command, except that it does
not require its own parser.


This sequence diagram shows how the `download` command works at a lower level:

![DownloadSequenceDiagram](images/commands/DownloadCommand/DownloadSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a CS2100 TA executes the download command:

![DownloadActivityDiagram](images/commands/DownloadCommand/DownloadActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

One of the main considerations was to deal with reading and writing files only when necessary. This meant checking if
there is any data to begin with. Only if there exists any data will the CS2100 TA be prompted to select a folder
destination.

Additionally, a pop-up message was chosen to be displayed for two reasons. First, it provides the user a clear visual
indicator of the result of their command, as compared to the typical textual output they would see. Second, we would
only know if the data was successfully downloaded after the textual response is shown to the user. Using a pop-up
message right at the end of this operation means we can customise the message depending on whether the download was a
success.

### Alternatives

1. One alternative could be to not use a third-party package (`org.json`), and instead manually parse the json file and
   write the corresponding values to a CSV file which ProgrammerError would create. We chose not to go down this route
   as it is much more tedious with little reward in terms of code management and code quality.


2. Another alternative with respect to the CS2100 TA experience could be to disallow the user from selecting a folder to save
   their data to. Instead, a default location could be chosen so as to save the CS2100 TA some time in getting their data
   downloaded quickly. However, since we wanted to make ProgrammerError more flexible and adaptable to different users, we opted to include the
   functionality of allowing the CS2100 TA to select a folder destination.


### Purge Feature

## <a name="Effort"></a> **18. Appendix: Effort**
  
### Challenges Faced and Achievements Made
The following is a non-exhaustive list of challenges we encountered during the development of ProgrammerError:
  1. **Rewriting the Command Syntax** 
  - This was challenging as it required a nuanced understanding of how CLI syntax is constructed and following standard conventions. 
  - Not all of us were familiar with Unix syntax, which made it more difficult to design a solution that would be suitable for users who prefer typing.
  2. **Designing New UI components**
  - AB3 uses a simple components with an (arguably) poor user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). On the other hand, our team revamped the look and feel of the application, customizing the dark theme specially (using GitHub's color scheme) to suit TAs. This involved much experimentation with color schemes and building new components, such as popup windows to enhance the user experience. 
  - Other examples include: color-coding the labs which are marked or unmarked (displayed as green or red respectively), as well as customizing the Help window and Dashboard Window to incorporate our new Dark Theme.
  3. **Working with Third-Party Libraries**
  - Compared to AB3 which does not use minimal third-party libraries for its features, our team integrated two additional external libraries to develop our `upload` and `download` features. 
  - This was more challenging than it initally seemed as it required trying out multiple potential candidate libraries to find those which are most suitable for our use case and would be compatible across multiple operating systems. 
  - Through this process, we also encountered dependency issues with the new libraries and spent significant time and effort debugging these issues.
  4. **Implementing Dynamic Features**
  - AB3's features typically work by having the user type in text commands to be executed. We felt this was core, but we wanted to go a step further and implement our features to minimise the TA having to type unecessary commands.
  - For instance, the list of students always remains sorted whenever updates are made to the student data. This required many checks and careful organization of the student data so that the sorting can be done efficiently at minimal cost to the user TA.
  - Additionally, the dashboard feature was also designed to update dynamically whenever changes are made to the student data. This saves the TA much time in keeping track of the labs they have yet to mark, thereby enhancing their user experience and satisfaction.
