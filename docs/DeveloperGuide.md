PlannerMD is an easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI) application that helps clinic receptionists seamlessly integrate the daily appointments and the unique requirements of each patient into a single application. PlannerMD expedites the manual processes found in a clinic and saves clinics receptionists plenty of time while also reducing human error.

The purpose of the Developer Guide is to guide you through the architecture of our program, so you can familiarise yourself with its underlying structure.

### Architecture <a name="architecture"/>

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/plannermd/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/plannermd/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component <a name="ui"/>

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonTab`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `PersonTab` is a tab layout that consists of a `PatientListPanel` and a `DoctorListPanel`. Only one of the tabs is displayed to the user at a particular time, and the user can toggle between the 2 tabs.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/plannermd/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component <a name="logic"/>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it gets the current state (i.e. whether the user is on the `Patients` or `Doctors` tab) from the `Model`.
2. It then uses the `PlannerMdParser` class to parse the user command.
3. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a patient).
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PlannerMdParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which the `PlannerMdParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* If the `PlannerMdParser` parses an appointment command (e.g., `appt -a`, `appt -e`, ...), it first creates an `AppointmentCommandParser` to parse the flags given (e.g., `-a`, `-e`, ...). The `AppointmentCommandParser` then creates an `XYZCommandParser` (e.g., `AddAppointmentCommandParser`) to parse the remaining user command.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`, `DeleteDoctorCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component <a name="model"/>
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/plannermd/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

Here's the class diagram of the `Person` component within `Model`:
![PersonClassDiagram](images/PersonClassDiagram.png)

Heres the class diagram of the `Appointment` component within `Model`:
![AppointmentClassDiagram](images/AppointmentClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the plannerMD data  
  * all `Patient` and `Doctor` objects (which are contained in `UniquePersonList<Patient>` and `UniquePersonList<Doctor>` respectively).
  * all `Appointment` objects (which are contained in `UniqueAppointmentList<Patient>`).
* stores the currently active `State` (which determines which list of Person, `Patient` or `Doctor`, to interact with)
* stores the currently 'selected' `Patient`, `Doctor` and `Appointment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>`, `ObservableList<Doctor>`  and `ObservableList<Appointment>` respectively that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component <a name="storage"/>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/plannermd/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both PlannerMD data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `PlannerMdStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes  <a name="common-classes"/>

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.plannermd.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation** <a name="implementation"/>

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Stateful PlannerMD <a name="stateful-plannermd"/>
With the introduction of two types of `Person` (`Patient` and `Doctor`) and their respective lists,
a state is used to determine which list should be interacted with.

The state is maintained in `ModelManager`
* Two possible states (`State.PATIENT` and `State.DOCTOR`)
* `ModelManager::toggleState` is used to switch between states
* The UI displays the list according to the state. (eg. if the state is `State.PATIENT`, UI displays the filtered list of patients)
* Commands are parsed based on the state. (eg. if a valid 'add' command is parsed and the state is `State.PATIENT`, an `AddPatientCommand` is executed)

#### Design considerations
Since it is likely that clinic would be mainly interacting with patient records, we did not want to display both lists within the UI  at the same time as the additional clutter
would be less user-friendly. Also, since commands for records are applicable to both patients and doctors, we wanted to avoid flags for record commands and keep them as succinct as possible. <br>
Therefore, we decided to introduce a state, allowing us to display the list the user desires and execute commands according to the state.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Toggle command <a name="toggle-command"/>
Command used to toggle displayed tab and the current state of PlannerMD.

The Activity Diagram below illustrates the execution flow when the user executes a `toggle` command.<br>

![ToggleActivityDiagram](images/ToggleActivityDiagram.png)

1. The user inputs a `toggle` command.
2. A `ToggleCommand` is generated and executed.
   * If the currently displayed tab is the patient tab, it is toggled to the doctor tab.
   * If the currently displayed tab is the doctor tab, it is toggled to the patient tab.
3. The GUI displays a success message.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation
The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute("toggle") API call in Patient state.

![ToggleCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ToggleCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `plannerMdParser::parseCommand` is called with the user input "toggle" along with the current `Model.state` (`State.Pateint`). <br>
   1.1 A `ToggleCommand` instance is instantiated.
2. `ToggleCommand::execute` is called<br>
   3.1. `Model::toggleState` is called and toggles `Model.State` from `State.Patient` to `State.Doctor`<br>
   3.2. A `CommandResult` instance is instantiated with a success message.
3. The `CommandResult` is then returned

The GUI updates the list according to the current state(eg. displays patient list if `Model.state` is `State.Patient`) and display the success message given by `CommandResult`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Remark <a name="remark"/>

#### Remark field
A field added for `Person` and thus applies to both `Patient` and `Doctor`. Remark is miscellaneous information
stored as a String.
* No restrictions, `Remark` can be any `String`, including empty.
* `Remark` is an empty String by default.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Remark command
Command used to edit the `Remark` field of a Person.
* No input restrictions, input can be any `String`, including empty.
    * empty input effectively deletes the current `Remark` and the Remark field will not be displayed in the UI at all.

The activity Diagram below illustrates the execution flow when the user executes a `remark` command. <br>

![RemarkActivityDiagram](images/RemarkActivityDiagram.png)

1. The user inputs a `remark` command.
2. The input is parsed <br>
    * If the `INDEX` is invalid, invalid prefixes are inputted or the remark prefix `/r` is missing, a `ParseException` is thrown and an error message is displayed.
3. A `RemarkCommand` is generated and executed.
    * If remark input is empty, effectively deletes the remark, generate successful delete remark message.
    * If remark input is not empty, effectively deletes the remark, generate successful edit remark message.
4. The GUI displays a success message.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation
The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the execute("remark 1 r/bad cough") API call. <br>

![RemarkSequenceDiagram](images/RemarkSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `plannerMdParser::parseCommand` is called with the user input "remark 1 r/bad cough" along with the current `Model.state`. <br>
   1.1 A `RemarkCommandParser` instance is instantiated.
2. `RemarkCommandParser::parse` is called with input "1 r/bad cough" <br>
   2.1 A `RemarkCommand` instance is instantiated.
3. `RemarkCommand::execute` is called<br>
   3.1. `Model::setPatient` is called and replaces the patient with edited patient in the patient list.<br>
   3.2. A `CommandResult` instance is instantiated with a success message.
4. The `CommandResult` is then returned


The GUI updates the patient record in the displayed list and displays a success message.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Propagating patient/doctor changes to appointments <a name="propagating-person-changes-to-appointment-list"/>
Since specific patients and doctors within the records are directly referenced in appointments,
changes in patients and doctors through user command or otherwise needs to be propagated through the appointment list.
* When patients or doctor deleted, appointments they are a part of will be deleted as well.
  * `DeleteCommand`
* When patients or doctor details are changed, these changes will be reflected in appointments they are a part of.
  * `RemarkCommand`, `EditCommand` and `TagCommand`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation
The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Model component for the deletePatient(target) API call.

![PropagateChangesDiagram](images/PropagateChangesDiagram.png)

1. `PlannerMd::removePatient` is called and deletes `target` from the list of patients. <br>
2. `UniqueAppointmentList::deleteAppointmentWithPerson` is called <br>
   * Loops through `UniqueAppointmentList` and deletes `appointment` which references `target`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Model component for the setPatient(patientToEdit, editedPatient) API call.

![PropagateChangesEditDiagram](images/PropagateChangesEditDiagram.png)

1. `PlannerMd::setPatient` is called and replaces `patientToEdit` with `editedPatient` in the list of patients. <br>
2. `UniqueAppointmentList::editAppointmentWithPerson` is called <br>
    * Loops through `UniqueAppointmentList` and replaces `appointment` which references `patientToEdit` with a new `editedAppointment` which has the same fields as `appointment` but references `editedPatient`.
    

GUI is updated to display the propagated changes in the appointment list.

#### Design considerations
Since `Appointment` unilaterally has references `Patient` and `Doctor`, the `UniqueAppointmentList` has to be iterated
to update `Appointment` with references to `Patient` or `Doctor` which were edited or delete `Appointment` when they have references to the deleted `Patient` or `Doctor`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding an appointment <a name="adding-an-appointment"/>
Adding an appointment requires the user to input valid patient and doctor indexes, and the correct format for each prefix.
The diagram below illustrates the flow of adding an appointment:
![AddAppointment](images/AddAppointmentActivityDiagram.png)

![AddAppointment](images/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)
1. After user enters the add appointment command `appt -a` with the relevant prefix, the input will be sent
   to `AddAppointmentCommandParser` for parsing.
2. `AddAppointmentCommandParser` will check if the prefixes are relevant. If the prefixes are relevant, a new `AddAppointmentCommand` which extends `AppointmentCommand`
   is created. The `AddAppointmentCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the abstract class `Command`. If the prefixes are not relevant,
   a `ParseException` will be thrown, and the missing prefixes' error message will be shown.
3. The `AddAppointmentCommand` will run `execute()`. First, it retrieves the `Patient` object and the `Doctor` object at the given index from the model. If the index is out of range of the
   `Model#FilteredPatientList` or `Model#FilteredDoctorList`, it will throw an error, and the invalid index message will be shown.
   If not, the `Appointment` object with the is created and added to the model. The add appointment success message is then returned.
4. The UI will then display the result

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting an appointment <a name="deleting-an-appointment"/>
Deleting an appointment requires the user to input a valid index of the desired appointment in the appointment list.
The diagram below illustrates the flow of deleting an appointment:<br>

![DeleteAppointment](images/DeleteAppointmentActivityDiagram.png)

![DeleteAppointment](images/DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)
1. After user enters the delete appointment command `appt -d` with an index, the input will be sent
   to `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser` for parsing.
2. `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser` will check if the index is valid. If the index is valid, a new `DeleteAppointmentCommand` 
   which extends `AppointmentCommand` is created. If not, a `ParseException` will be thrown, and the invalid index message will be shown.
3. The `DeleteAppointmentCommand` will run `execute()`, removing the appointment at the inputted index. Then, it will return the
   success message as a `CommandResult` object.
4. The UI will then display the result

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing an appointment <a name="editing-an-appointment"/> 

Edits the details of an existing appointment.

The edit appointment command accepts at least one of the following parameters:
* Patient index
* Doctor index
* Start date and time
* Duration (in minutes)
* Remark

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation

1. An `EditAppointmentCommandParser` is used to parse the edit appointment command. It checks if the patient and doctor indices are not out of bounds (based on the current filtered patient and doctor lists). The validity and format of the date and time as well as duration are also checked.
2. If the inputs are valid, an `EditAppointmentCommand` is created. The command is executed and attempts to edit the fields as specified in the user input. The edited appointment will be reflected in the filtered appointment list in `Model`.
3. Whenever an edited appointment results in a clash with existing appointments, the command is aborted and an error message is shown to the user.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("appt -e 2 p/1 dur/30")` API call.

![EditAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/EditAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AppointmentCommandParser` and `EditAppointmentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Filtering appointments <a name="filtering-appointments"/>

Filters through the appointment records in PlannerMD and shows the appointments that matches the filter parameters.

There are 4 possible parameters provided to a filter appointment command are:
* Patient keywords (Filters appointments whose patient's name contains one of the keywords provided)
* Doctor keywords (Filters appointments whose doctor's name contains one of the keywords provided)
* Start date (Filters appointments which has a starting date greater or equal to the start date provided)
* End date (Filters appointment which has a starting date lesser or equal to the end date provided)

If no parameters are provided, the command simply lists all appointments in the appointment records.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation

Upon entry of a filter appointment command, it is parsed by a `FilterAppointmentCommandParser` to check if the input parameters are valid (Dates are formatted correctly, `startDate` <= `endDate` if both parameters are provided). If the inputs are valid, an 'AppointmentFilters' is created and the filter parameters are stored in it. An 'AppointmentFilters' is an object that stores the different filter conditions a user can provide.

After that, the filter is used to create a `FilterAppointmentCommand`. When executed, the `FilterAppointmentCommand` takes the `AppointmentFilters` and converts it into a single predicate based on the filter parameters provided. The predicate is then used to update the filtered appointment list in `Model`.

Given below, is an example of a filter appointment command with the patient keywords and start date parameter provided.

A clearer view of this sequence diagram can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/docs/images/AppointmentFilterSequenceDiagram.png).

![FilterAppointmentCommand](images/AppointmentFilterSequenceDiagram.png)

![ConfigureAppointmentFilters](images/ConfigureAppointmentFilters.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storing an appointment <a name="storing-an-appointment"/>

Stores an Appointment object in the Json file by first creating the `JsonAdaptedAppointment` object, which is the Json representation of the `Appointment` object. 
Then, the `JsonAdaptedAppointment` is then contained within the `JsonSerializablePlannerMd` object and `JsonSerializablePlannerMd` is passed as parameter to `JsonUtil.saveJsonFile` to write all records,
including the `Appointment` object, into the file.

The implementation focuses on the creation of a single `JsonAdapatedAppointment` object after the user keys in a command that changes the current records.

#### Implementation

The creation of a `JsonAdaptedAppointment` will create the respective `JsonAdaptedPatient` and `JsonAdaptedDoctor` involved in the appointment. 
The creation of `JsonAdaptedPatient` and `JsonAdaptedDoctor` will create the number of tags that the respective `Patient` and `Doctor` objects have.

We use `JsonAdaptedPatient` and `JsonAdaptedDoctor` that are used to store `Patient` and `Doctor` standalone objects 
as Json to ensure that these objects are stored in a consistent format, whether as a standalone `Patient`/`Doctor` or
a `Patient`/`Doctor` in an `Appointment`.

The creation of a `JsonAdaptedAppointment` will also create the `JsonAdaptedSession`
which is synonymous to the `Session` object contained in an `Appointment`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Storage component for the creation of a `JsonAdaptedAppointment`.

## **Appendix: Requirements**  <a name="appendix-requirements"/>

### Product scope  <a name="product-scope"/>

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of patients
* needs quick access to a patient's data and profile
* needs to arrange/deconflict appointments for doctors
* prefers desktop applications over other types
* can type fast and prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: easily manage patients' information and doctors' appointments faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### User stories  <a name="user-stories"/>
