### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/placebook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/placebook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/placebook/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/placebook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/placebook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `PlacebookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PlacebookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `PlacebookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/placebook/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the contact data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores appointment data in `Appointment` objects (which contain `UniquePersonList` for clients, `Address` for location, `TimePeriod` for time period during which the appointment occurs, `String` for description)
* stores the schedule data i.e., all `Appointment` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Contacts`, which `Person` references. This allows `Contacts` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/placebook/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save contacts data, schedule data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ContactsStorage`, `ScheduleStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.placebook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### TimePeriod Class

#### Implementation

The feature is a variable contained within the `Appointment` class. `TimePeriod` tracks the start and end time
of the Appointment and contains functions to check if two appointments have clashing TimePeriods and thus
cannot both happen. Each `Appointment` class has a `TimePeriod` class, which represents the time period during 
which this appointment occurs. The `TimePeriod` class provides a function to check whether a time period overlaps
with another time period. `TimePeriod` is also used to calculate the urgency of the appointment, assigning the
appointment either `High`, `Medium` or `Low` urgency.

### Undo feature

The undo feature allows the users to undo the previous command and go back to the state before executing that command.

#### Implementation

To implement the undo feature, we need to record the status of PlaceBook after executing a certain command,
so that we can restore PlaceBook to its previous status by using that piece of recorded information.

We use a `State` to describe the status of PlaceBook at a certain time. 
The `State` contains a `Contacts`, a `Schedule`, a `Predicate<Person>`, a `Predicate<Appointment>` and a `command word`. 
After every execution of the normal commands,
we create a new `State` instance to record the status of PlaceBook after executing that command.
This `State` instance is like a snapshot of the PlaceBook at a certain moment.

In order to manage the different states, we have a `HistoryStates` class which has a data structure inside to store all the `State`. Stack and linked list are
usually used to store the history states. In PlaceBook, we use a linked list in `HistoryStates`.
After the execution of a normal command, a new `State` instance is created, and then we add this new `State` to the end of the linked list in `HistoryStates`.
When an `undo` command is encountered, we simply remove the last node of the linked list, so the current state pointer points to the previous node.
When there are no more nodes in the linked list except the initial state, the `undo` command cannot be executed and the `HistoryStates` will thrown a `NoHistoryStatesException`.

### AddApp feature

#### Implementation

The feature allows users to create an appointment with any number of clients (`Person`), 
along with a location (`Address`), a time period (`timePeriod`) and a description (`String`).
The addApp mechanism is facilitated by `Schedule`.

`Schedule` contains an Observable List of `Appointment` that we can add appointments to. These appointments will be
generated from the inputs entered by the user using the `AddAppCommand`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addApp mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. PlaceBook will be initialized with a `LogicManager`, a `StorageManage`, a `UiManager`
and a `ModelManager`. `StorageManager` contains an `ContactsStorage` an a `ScheduleStorage` which manages
the specific saved data. `StorageManager` will attempt to read data from a saved json file and loads the 
data into `ModelManager` when the class is initialized

![AddAppStep1](images/AddAppStep1.png)

Step 2. The user inputs the addApp command with `addApp id/1,2,3 a/Starbucks @ Raffles City start/01-01-2021 1400 end/01-01-2021 1500 ds/discuss marketing strategies`
The `logicManager`, which has been initialized with an `PlacebookParser`, will use that class to create and return an `addAppCommand` with the appropriate inputs to be executed by `LogicManger`

![AddAppStep2](images/AddAppStep2.png)

Step 3. On the execution of the command, the command will retrieve the list of persons and appointments from
`ModelManager` and create a new `UniquePersonList`. The new `UniquePersonList` will then be populated with the
appropriate client or clients retrieved from the list of persons according to the input index or indexes.
A new Appointment will then be created and added to the `ModelManager`. It is at this stage the input will
be checked to ensure that there are no duplicates or clashes with other appointments.


Step 4. After execution, the CommandResult is passed upwards to the UI so that it can return a status message
and update the display to match the updated model

The following sequence diagram shows how the addAppCommand operation works:

![AddAppSequenceDiagram](images/AddAppSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User selects `Person` in `Appointment` through indexes of the displayed list.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, every `Person` in the displayed list will have a unique index.
    * Cons: As the user filters the displayed list, the indexes may change and be re-ordered, causing some confusion to the user.
* **Alternative 2:** User selects `Person` in `Appointment` through the name field in `Person`
    * Pros: The user will have greater confidence that they are adding the correct person.
    * Cons: Longer command lines, especially if multiple `Person` added to the same `Appointment`. One spelling mistake in the name will cause an error. There the possibility that there are multiple `Person` with the same name.

### Filter & Sort Feature

#### Implementation

##### Filtering

The feature allows users to filter using `findApp` . The input of the command will be passed down through the parser into 
the findAppCommand as a `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate`, where on execution, this predicate is passed
into the initialized `ModelManager` filters the list of Appointments by setting this predicate in a 
FilteredList of Appointments, updating it to be displayed by the UI.

##### Sorting

The feature allows sort using one of two metrics, time of appointment or description, and return to the original list.
Using `listApp Time` or `listApp Description` will sort the list, and `listApp` will return the list of appointments to
its original display. This is also done through the `ModelManager`. The parser will first determine what type of `listApp`
is being input by the user, before passing it into `listAppCommand`. On execution, `listAppComand` will call `ModelManager`
functions to sort the list according to input and update the displayed list to be displayed by the UI

### Delete feature

#### Implementation

The delete feature deletes a person from the storage by specifying an index shown on the display list.

#### Design considerations

* This will likely be break the current data relations as those appointments that refer to this person will
no longer be able to query information about this person.
* Thus, we either:  
    1. implement a soft delete, which marks the data as 'deleted', so it will not be shown on the person list and keep 
    showing information about the person in the related appointment.
    2. remove the person from related appointments and delete the appointment if it has no more related client
* We chose the second one, and gives a warning message to user when they try to delete. As we think that, it makes 
little sense in this case to keep the person related to appointments show up event after they delete the person. Moreover,
  it makes the code harder to maintain, as we will need to consider whether the person is mark as deleted for every other 
  query.
  
### Handle invalid JSON data feature

#### Implementation

This feature checks if there are errors in the JSON file formats.
Below are the different situations that can occur and how it is resolved.

* If both files can be found and are valid, PlaceBook will use create `ModelManager` using the data in those files.

* If the `contacts.json` file is missing or invalid, PlaceBook will wipe both the Schedule and Contacts data, and create sample data for both.

* If the `schedule.json` file is missing or invalid, PlaceBook will wipe the Schedule data, but will not create a sample Schedule, so that there will not be discrepancies between Contacts and Schedule.

* If both files are missing or invalid, PlaceBook will create sample data for both Schedule and Contacts.

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1** Create sample data accordingly to the different situations mentioned above.
    * Pros: This will ensure that there are no appointments created that contain `Person` objects that are not in the contacts.
    * Cons: Have to consider many cases and how to handle them correctly. 
* **Alternative 2** Create sample data for each list, if their data file is missing or invalid.
    * Pros: Simpler logic and implementation.
    * Cons: May have discrepancies between the contacts and schedule, confusing the user.
    
### Ensure no discrepancies between contacts and schedule upon loading ModelManager

#### Implementation

This feature checks that if the user had modified the JSON files, there will not be any discrepancies between contacts and schedule.

While loading `ModelManager`, PlaceBook checks if there any `Appointment` objects that contain `Person` objects that are not in the contacts.

Upon finding such `Appointment` objects, PlaceBook will add the missing `Person` objects back to the contacts.

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1** Add missing persons back to contacts
    * Pros: This will ensure that the user will not have unexpected missing data.
    * Cons: The user might not notice that the person that they wanted to delete is still in the contacts.
* **Alternative 2** Delete appointments with missing persons
    * Pros: This will ensure that the persons the user deleted from the JSON will remain deleted.
    * Cons: The user might not have noticed that those appointments have been deleted.

### Command History Navigation feature

The Command History Navigation feature allows the users to navigate through the previous or next input command. This is useful
for repetitive tasks such as adding or deleting multiple appointments/clients.

#### Implementation

Successful user inputs are saved into the `CommandHistory` class, which keeps a List of `String` and a pointer. 
When the user presses `UP/DOWN` keys in the command box, the Keyboard event is triggered, which will call the 
`:commandHistory::getLastInput` and `:commandHistory::getNextInput` respectively. Then it will set the commandBox to the 
correct user input.

The implementation of `getLastInput` is such that when the user reaches the first input, and press `UP`, it will still show the first input.
The implementation of `getNextInput` is such that when the user reaches the last input, and press `DOWN`, it will show empty string `""`.

### Theme Change feature

The Theme Change feature allows users to change the theme of the GUI from light to dark. 

#### Implementation

Stores the style information in separate `.css` files, such as `darkTheme.css` and `lightTheme.css`.
Specifically, The use of global variables in the newly added `lightTheme.css`, improves maintainability and consistency of the style.

The App is loaded with a default theme, in `v1.4`, the lightTheme. Then the `UiManager` keeps a `ThemeManager` object, in which the theme information
like the path to the stylesheet and the button image is stored. When the theme change button is pressed, the click event will call the `changeTheme` method 
in the `themeManager`, which will remove the previous stylesheet from the `MainWindow` and add the new stylesheet.

Moreover, other windows such as the `deleteConfirmationWindow`, can also get the current stylesheet by `getCurrentStylesheet` method
