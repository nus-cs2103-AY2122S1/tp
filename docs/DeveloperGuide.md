## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/intern/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/intern/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/intern/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicantListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/intern/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Applicant` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/intern/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `InternWatcherParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an applicant).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternWatcherParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `InternWatcherParser` returns a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/intern/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the Intern Watcher data i.e., all `Applicant` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicantList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Applicant` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Applicant>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Skill` list in the `InternWatcher`, which `Applicant` references. This allows `InternWatcher` to only require one `Skill` object per unique skill, instead of each `Applicant` needing their own `Skill` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/intern/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both Intern Watcher data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InternWatcherStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.intern.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details and design considerations on how certain features are implemented.

###  Add feature

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: Prevent duplicate entries**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Disallow entries with duplicate names in a case-insensitive manner.
    - Pros: Easy to implement
    - Cons: Disallow different people of same name to be added to the app at the same time.
- **Alternative 2**: Create and use another unique field for the applicants and use that for identification.
    - Pros: Allow for multiple entries with the same name.
    - Cons: Harder to implement. Users may abuse the `add` command intentionally and unintentionally.<br>

Therefore, with the above consideration and the fact that different applicants sharing same name is relatively rare case, we decided to proceed with alternative 1.
<br>
<br>
**Aspect: Restriction over graduation year month**
<br>
As internship has timeliness as its nature and our application development only started in 2021, it would be more reasonable for us to set January 2020 to be the lower bound of accepted graduation year month to give HRs some allowance to keep some previous data. However, anyone who graduated before such said time will not likely be looking for an internship anymore, and therefore should be disallowed in our system.


###  Edit ALL feature

#### Implementation
* The edit ALL mechanism is facilitated by the new `Selection` class. A new parser `ParserUtil#parseSelection`
has been added to parse `Selection` values, which accepts either integers or the `ALL` string. The `Selection` class supports
operations `Selection#hasAllSelectFlag` and `Selection#hasIndex`, which is used by `EditCommand#execute`. 
<br>
* `EditCommand#execute`
has been modified, such that whenever `Selection#hasAllSelectFlag` returns `true`, `EditCommand#execute` edits all applicants with
the fields specified. 
<br>
* `Selection` has been given a private constructor with static factory methods `Selection#fromIndex` and
`Selection#fromAllFlag` to ensure `Selection` should not contain both index and all flag.

The following activity diagrams summarizes what happens when a user enters an `edit` command.

<img src="images/EditActivityDiagram.png" width="500"/>

Edit ALL updates the details of all currently displayed applicants by obtaining the list of currently displayed applicants via `Model#getFilteredApplicantList`.
The list is then copied, after which each individual applicant is modified via `Model#setApplicant` in a for loop.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters an `edit``ALL` command.

<img src="images/EditAllSequenceDiagram.png"/>

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How edit ALL is parsed**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Modify the parser to parse the `Selection`, accepting a special flag to indicate all applicants
should be edited.
    - Pros: Easy to implement
    - Cons: `EditCommand` and its related parsers may become harder to test since its behaviour is now different depending
    on the user input.
- **Alternative 2**: Create a separate `EditAllCommand` with its own parser.
    - Pros: Easier to test, the behaviour of `EditAllCommand` should not affect `EditCommand`.
    - Cons: Harder to implement. Users might also find editing multiple applicants having a separate command unintuitive.

**Aspect: How edit arguments are stored**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create a `Selection` class with private constructor and static factory methods to store either the
  `ALL` flag or the `Index`.
    - Pros: Disallows `ALL` flag to exist together with `Index`, making debugging easier. Keeps modifications to existing classes minimal.
    - Cons: Most `EditCommand` tests would have to be changed to accommodate the new constructor. `Selection`
- **Alternative 2**: Overload `EditCommand` constructor to accept an additional boolean flag.
    - Pros: Easy to implement, existing classes/methods need not be changed.
    - Cons: Additional parser method must be created. Users may unintentionally pass both `ALL` and `Index` to parser.

**Aspect: What fields can edit ALL accept**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Only allow mass modifications to `ApplicationStatus`.
    - Pros: Users cannot unintentionally modify all applicants' personal details, such as `Name`, `Email`, `Grade`.
      There should not be a reason to mass modify these fields. If a user created a number of applicants with the wrong details
      `UndoCommand` can be used instead.
    - Cons: Usage of `edit ALL` would be limited.
- **Alternative 2**: Allow mass modifications of all fields
    - Pros: `edit ALL` behaviour can be kept similar to `edit INDEX`, increasing usability.
    - Cons: Allows users to unintentionally modify applicant fields that should normally not require mass edits.

###  Delete ALL feature

#### Implementation
* The delete ALL mechanism is facilitated by the new `Selection` class shared with edit ALL. A new parser `ParserUtil#parseSelection`
has been added to parse `Selection` values, which accepts either integers or the `ALL` string. The `Selection` class supports
operations `Selection#hasAllSelectFlag` and `Selection#hasIndex`, which is used by `DeleteCommand#execute`. 
<br>
* `DeleteCommand#execute`
has been modified, such that whenever `Selection#hasAllSelectFlag` returns `true`, `DeleteCommand#execute` delete all applicants on the displayed list. 
<br>
* `Selection` has been given a private constructor with static factory methods `Selection#fromIndex` and
`Selection#fromAllFlag` to ensure `Selection` should not contain both index and all flag.

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How delete ALL is parsed**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Modify the parser to parse the `Selection`, accepting a special flag to indicate all applicants
  should be deleted.
    - Pros: Easy to implement, shares the same model with `edit ALL`.
    - Cons: `DeleteCommand` and its related parsers may become harder to test since its behaviour is now different depending
      on the user input.
- **Alternative 2**: Create a special `Index` of -1 when ALL tag is attached, as such, only when the index is -1, will we execute 'delete All'
    - Pros: Easy to implement
    - Cons: Bypasses the intention of the Index Class. Having a negative `Index` might throw unexpected errors.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters an `delete ALL` command.

![DeleteAllSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteAllSequenceDiagram.png)
    
### Filter feature

#### Implementation

* The filter mechanism is facilitated by `FilterCommandParser`. `FilterCommandParser` produces a `FilterApplicantDescriptor`, which in turn helps to create a `FilterCommand`.
<br/>
* `Optional` and `Set` data structures have been used to contain optional set of filters for different fields within `FilterApplicantDescriptor`.
<br/>
* The `FilterCommand` will make use of the `FilterApplicantDescriptor` to create a `CombineFiltersPredicate` that will be supplied to `ModelManager#updateFilteredApplicantList(Predicate<Applicant>)` in its `execute` method.
<br/>
* `ModelManager` helps filter through the applicant list with specified filter criteria contained and interpreted by the `CombineFiltersPredicate#test()`.
![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/filter/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How filter for different fields work**
- **Name, Phone, Email**: These fields are excluded from filter criteria as `filter` is supposed to serve the purpose of selecting potential candidates based on practical considerations other than these three fields.
- **Grade**: HRs should be more interested in finding candidates whose grades meet a certain threshold. Therefore, only applicants that have grades not smaller than the input `Grade` will be displayed.
- **GraduationYearMonth**: HRs should be more interested in finding candidates who graduate before a certain period and who are readily available for deployment before internship starts. Therefore, only applicants that graduate strictly earlier than the input `GraduationYearMonth` will be displayed.
- **Institutions**: HRs should be more open to accept applicants from a collection of institutions. For example, HRs may be interested in finding applicants that are from either NUS or NTU as the company has affiliation programme with the said two institutions. Also, such filters should be case-insensitive as the capitalisation is not meaningful when considering the said fields.
- **Jobs**: HRs should be more interested in filtering applicants for a range of related jobs. For example, HRs may be interested in choosing appropriate applicants for both software engineer and software tester as the requirements for both jobs are similar, and it is easier to look at both at once. Also, such filters should be case-insensitive as the capitalisation is not meaningful when considering the said fields.
- **Skills**: HRs should be more interested to use multiple `Skill` filters to exclusively find applicants that have all skills required in order to perform the applied job. And the filters shall be case-sensitive as capitalisation may differentiate two seemingly same skills.
- **Statues**: HRs should be more interested to only look at certain groups of applicants filtered by a selection of `Status` filters. For example, a HR wishes to delete all applicants to a job except for those "accepted" after the job is filled up. This filter shall be case-sensitive as it is a special tag that has pre-defined elements.
- **Courses**: HRs should be more interested to find applicants from a collection of courses as one same job can be assigned to applicants from similar but different courses. Also, the filter shall be case-insensitive.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedInternWatcher`. It extends `InternWatcher` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `watcherStateList` and `currStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedInternWatcher#commitState()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current Intern Watcher state in its history.
* `VersionedInternWatcher#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous Intern Watcher state from its history.
* `VersionedInternWatcher#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone Intern Watcher state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitInternWatcher()`, `Model#undoInternWatcher()` and `Model#redoInternWatcher()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedInternWatcher` will be initialized with the initial Intern Watcher state, and the `currStatePointer` pointing to that single Intern Watcher state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/undo-redo/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th applicant in the applicant list . The `delete` command calls `Model#commitInternWatcher()`, causing the modified state of the applicant list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `watcherStateList`, and the `currStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Intern Watcher state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/undo-redo/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new applicant. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitInternWatcher()`, causing another modified Intern Watcher state to be saved into the `watcherStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/undo-redo/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitInternWatcher()`, so the Intern Watcher state will not be saved into the `watcherStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the applicant was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoInternWatcher()`, which will shift the `currStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous state, and restores the applicant list to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/undo-redo/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Intern Watcher state, then there are no previous Intern Watcher states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoInternWatcher()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/undo-redo/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoInternWatcher()`, which shifts the `currStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the applicant list to that state.

![UndoRedoState6](images/undo-redo/UndoRedoState6.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currStatePointer` is at index `watcherStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Intern Watcher state, then there are no undone Intern Watcher states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoInternWatcher()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. Let's say that the user goes through with the Undo command and the `currStatePointer` points to the previous state. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the applicant list, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitInternWatcher()`, `Model#undoInternWatcher()` or `Model#redoInternWatcher()`. Thus, the `watcherStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/undo-redo/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitInternWatcher()`. Since the `currStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `watcherStateList`, all Intern Watcher states after the `currStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behaviour that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/undo-redo/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/undo-redo/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire applicant list.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the applicant being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

**Aspect: How to store saved states:**

* **Alternative 1:** Use two stack data structures, one for Command history and one for Undo history.
    * Pros: Using a stack is intuitive for undo/redo as the current state is simply the top of the Command History stack. When undo is executed, the top of the stack can be popped and added into the Undo History stack.
    * Cons: We must implement and manage two stacks for the functionality.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use array list data structure with a pointer.
    * Pros: Easy to implement. Only requires one data structure for both undo and redo.
    * Cons: The array list must be constantly updated and purged when a new undoable command is executed.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Save file is missing: A new save file `internwatcher.json` will be created on `exit` the next time Intern Watcher is used.
   2. Save file is corrupted: If invalid data is present, such as a person with phone number `abcd`, Intern Watcher will start with
   an empty applicant list instead.
   3. Save file applicant has duplicate fields: If an applicant has duplicate fields, such as two `phone` key value pairs, Intern Watcher
   will parse the applicant with the last `phone` value.
