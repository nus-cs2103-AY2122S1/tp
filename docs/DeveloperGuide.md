### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

### Data Archiving Features
#### Add feature

The add feature is facilitated by `AddCommand`. It extends `Command` with a person as parameter where the person to be added is stored internally as a `toAdd`. The add mechanism relies on `ModelManager#addPerson()` to add the Person to be added to the `personList` in `ModelManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works. For simplicity the command `add n/John Doe p/98765432 a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/friends t/owesMoney g/john-doe N/e0123456 r/student s/A0123456X T/11` is simplified to `add {person details}`

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Edit feature

The edit feature is facilitated by `EditCommand`. It extends `Command` with an Index and EditPersonDescriptor as parameter where the person to be edited is stored at index in the `personList` and EditPersonDescriptor stored the details of the edited fields. The edit mechanism relies on `ModelManager#setPerson()` to edit the Person in the `personList` in `ModelManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works.

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Bulk Tag feature

The bulk tag feature is facilitated by `BulkTagCommand`. It extends `Command` with a Tag as a parameter. The addition of the Tag relies on `ModelManager#setPerson()` to edit the Person in the `personList` in `ModelManager` by specifically adding the given Tag to the person.
One important consideration for the command is that the bulk tag command does not affect the existing tags and thus functions differently as compared to the edit command.


#### Import feature

The import feature is facilitated by `ImportCommand`. It extends `Command` with a file path where the targeted import file is stored, stored internally as a `filePath`. It also overwrites the `execute` function to import the json file from the file path stored.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#importFile(Path filePath)`. This is further facilitated by an additional function in `AddressBook`, `AddressBook#mergeFile`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the import operation works:
![ImportSequenceDiagram](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Export feature

The export feature is facilitated by `ExportCommand`. It extends `Command` with a filepath where the exported contact list should be stored, stored internally as a `filePath`. It also overwrites the `execute` function to export the last searched contact list to a json file in the file path stored.

The following sequence diagram shows how the export operation works:
![Sequence of the Export command](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)

#### ExportEmail feature

The export feature is facilitated by `ExportEmailCommand`. It extends `Command` with a filepath where the exported contact list should be stored, stored internally as a `filePath`. It also overwrites the `execute` function to export the last searched contact list to a list of emails in the file path stored.

The following sequence diagram shows how the export operation works:
![Sequence of the ExportEmail command](images/ExportEmailSequenceDiagram.png)

### Address Book Management

#### Delete feature

The `delete` mechanism relies on `ModelManager#deletePerson()`. The Person(s) to be deleted is obtained through `ModelManager#getFilteredPersonList()`

Below is a sequence diagram for deleting a Person from the address book, executed after the user inputs `delete 1`

![Sequence of the Delete command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

`DeleteCommand` also exposes 2 factory methods:
- `DeleteCommand#allShown()` returns a `DeleteCommand` which deletes all Persons shown in the main window.
- `DeleteCommand#all()` which deletes all Persons in the address book.

Below is a sequence diagram for the deleting all shown Persons executed after the user inputs `delete -f` or `delete -a -f`. `DeleteCommand` iterates through the list returned by `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to delete all Persons shown in the main window.

![Sequence of the Delete All Shown command](images/DeleteAllShownSequenceDiagram.png)

The `DeleteCommand` returned by `DeleteCommand#all()` uses `AddressBook#resetData()` exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setAddressBook()` to clear the address book by passing in an empty `AddressBook`.

#### Sort Feature

The sort feature is facilitated by `SortCommand`. It extends `Command` with a `Prefix` which specifies the prefix the `AddressBook` is to be sorted by, as well as a boolean `reverse` which specifies the order of the sorted list.
This method is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#sortAddressBook()` This is further facilitated by  `AddressBook`, `AddressBook#sortList()`, a `PersonComparator` and a `Person#compare(Person p, Prefix prefix)` method to allow for sorting of the list by the `Prefix` specified.

##### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How sort executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts the list saved inside the `Model`'s `AddressBook`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Users might just want a temporary sorting of the list and not a permanent sorting.

* **Alternative 2:** Sorts the `filteredPersons` list shown by the `Model`.
    * Pros: Allow users to have a temporary sorting of the list, which they can later export if they want to be permanent.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement, as the `FilteredList` data structure used by `filteredPersons` cannot be mutated.

#### Statistic Feature
The statistic feature is facilitated by `StatCommand`. It overwrites the `execute` function to get a count of the various tags, types and tutorial ID of the last searched contact list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the statistic operation works:
![Sequence of the ExportEmail command](images/StatSequenceDiagram.png)


### Search features

#### Find feature

The find feature is facilitated by `FindCommand`. It extends `Command` with a type to be searched, as well as the key to be searched. This feature uses `AttributeContainsKeywordsPredicate#test(Person)` and the person to be searched is obtained using `ModelManager#getFilteredPersonList()`. If a search using a partial match can be done, the feature also uses `AttributeContainsKeywordsPredicate#testByType(Person, String)`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works for a name:
![FindCommandNameSequenceDiagram](images/FindNameSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works for a Tutorial ID:
![FindCommandTutIdSequenceDiagram](images/FindTutorialIdSequenceDiagram.png)

### Undo and Redo Features

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `OperationManager`, which stores 2 stacks of `Operation`, one for `redo` (`redoStack`) and one for `undo` (`undoStack`).

Each `Operation` stores a `ModelManagerState` which encapsulates the state of `ModelManager` by storing `AddressBook`, `UserPrefs`, and `Predicate<Person>`.

`OperationManager` exposes the following methods:
* `OperationManager#run()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current model manager state to history then runs an operation.
* `OperationManager#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous model manager state from its history.
* `OperationManager#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Redoes the last undone operation.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

`OperationManager#undo()` pops an `Operation` from `undoStack`, then pushes it to the `redoStack`.

`OperationManager#redo()` pops an `Operation` from `redoStack`, then pushes it to the `undoStack`.

`OperationManager#run()` clears `redoStack` as any remaining redoes are invalidated by the last run command.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The system should be usable by a novice who has never used any similar application.
5. The project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a new version every 2 weeks.

## Effort
The difficulty level for our project is at a relatively moderate level. Instead of making large changes to AB3, we opted to enhance existing features and introduce new features which complement the existing functionalities.
 
The challenges we faced were largely from figuring out the original implementation of AB3 so that we can introduce features by extending the structure of AB3 instead of overhauling.

For example, when implementing the `sort` feature, there were many different list representations of the contacts used throughout the application, some of which were immutable. It required time and effort to walk through the code, and sufficiently test modifications to ensure that the `sort` feature modifies the correct mutable list, and that there were no unintended side effects from directly manipulating the list.

Another feature which required much effort was the `undo` and `redo` commands. In order to implement them with minimal changes to existing code, we had to investigate how all data changes are propagated following the execution of their calling command. Then, we had to write an implementation which allowed us to decouple any new classes required from those that already existed. In the end, we settled on using functional interfaces and Java lambdas to offer an intuitive syntax and to follow software engineering principles. The only required changes to old code were to wrap existing methods in `ModelManager` in a lambda function which is passed to a new `OperationManager` class as `Runnable`, from which `OperationManager` handles all states changes, transparent to other developers. <br>

In comparison to AB3, ProfBook was a harder project due to the large amounts of information attached to each contact.
Managing all that information and making sure that each of our features work with the information in an intuitive way was one of the bigger achievements of ProfBook. <br>

Another big achievement of the project was how we integrated import and export features to ProfBook so that the information in ProfBook is portable and can be transferred between users easily. 
Since the output/input file is a JSON file, it can be used in conjunction with other apps as well.
