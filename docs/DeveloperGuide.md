### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `addFav A0123456A`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ModuLinkParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `CreateCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("addFav")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addFav` Command](images/AddFavSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddFavCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ModuLinkParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CreateCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CreateCommand`) which the `ModuLinkParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CreateCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores ModuLink data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both ModuLink data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ModuLinkStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.modulink.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Create A Profile
#### Implementation
The `create` mechanism will allow the user to create a personal profile.

The implementation required the creation of a parser for `CreateCommand` as the command does takes in parameters (personal information, module information etc..).
`CreateCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then update to include the created profile and the current user's profile will be highlighted in the GUI.
After creating a profile, the user can now use other commands in ModuLink.

#### Usage
To use this function and create a profile, simply enter the command and the required parameters in the command line in the following format.
`create n/NAME id/STUDENT_ID p/PHONE e/EMAIL [mod/TAG]...` <br/>
Example: `create n/John Doe id/A1234567Z p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com mod/CS2100 mod/CS2101`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `create` mechanism works:
![CreateSequenceDiagram](images/CreateSequenceDiagram.png)


### Add A Module Tag
#### Implementation
The `addMod` mechanism will allow the user to add a module tag to their profile.

The implementation required the creation of a parser for `addModCommand` as the command does takes in parameters.
`addModCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then update to include the tags for the user profile.

#### Usage
To use this function and create a profile, simply enter the command and the required parameters in the command line in the following format.
`addMod [mod/MOD]...` <br/>
Example: `addMod mod/CS2103T`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addMod` mechanism works:
![AddModSequenceDiagram](images/AddModSequenceDiagram.png)


### Add A Profile As Favourite
#### Implementation
The `addFav` mechanism will allow the user to add a module tag to their profile.

The implementation required the creation of a parser for `addFavCommand` as the command does takes in parameters.
`addFavCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then update to show the specified profile as a favourite.

#### Usage
To use this function and create a profile, simply enter the command and the required parameters in the command line in the following format.
`addFav Student_ID` <br/>
Example: `addFav A1234567X`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addFav` mechanism works:
![AddFavSequenceDiagram](images/AddFavSequenceDiagram.png)


### List All Favourited Profiles
#### Implementation
The `listFav` mechanism will allow the user to view all the students that he/she has favourited.

The implementation did not require the creation of a parser for `ListFavCommand` as the command does not take in any parameters.
`ListFavCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then change the content to display all favourited profiles. 

#### Usage
To use this function to see all favourited profiles, simply enter `listFav` in the command line. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `listFav` mechanism works:
![ListFavSequenceDiagram](images/ListFavSequenceDiagram.png)


### Filter Profiles By Module and Optionally Group Status
#### Implementation
The `filter` mechanism will allow the user to filter profiles by module and optionally group status.

The implementation required the creation of a parser for `filterCommand` as the command does takes in parameters.
`filterCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then update to show the profiles that contain the specified modules and/or group status.

#### Usage
To use this function and create a profile, simply enter the command and the required parameters in the command line in the following format.
`filter mod/MODULE [group/GROUP_STATUS]` <br/>
Example: `filter mod/CS2103T group/SM`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `filter` mechanism works:
![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

### Edit Group Status of Modules
#### Implementation
The `editGroupStatus` mechanism will allow the user to edit the group status of the modules on their profile.

The implementation required the creation of a parser for `editGroupStatusCommand` as the command does takes in parameters.
`editGroupStatusCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then update to show the updated group status for the specified module.

#### Usage
To use this function and create a profile, simply enter the command and the required parameters in the command line in the following format.
`editGroupStatus mod/MODULE group/GROUP_STATUS` <br/>
Example: `editGroupStatus mod/CS2103T group/Need member`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `editGroupStatus` mechanism works:
![EditGroupStatusDiagram](images/EditGroupStatusCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
