### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and `Folder` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueFolderList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Folder` objects (e.g., results of a search query)) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Folder>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Create a folder: `mkdir`

#### Implementation

Folders are saved in a `UniqueFolderList` in `AddressBook`.

The following diagram shows how `mkdir` works:

![CreateFolderSequenceDiagram](images/CreateFolderSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Folders hold references to contacts
  * Pros: Easier management of folders
  * Cons: More difficult to implement

Diagram:

![CreateFolderAlternative1](images/CreateFolderAlternative1.png)

* **Alternative 2**: Contacts hold references to folders
    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Cons: More complex management of folders, Similar to tags which is already implemented

Diagram:

![CreateFolderAlternative2](images/CreateFolderAlternative2.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### View list of folders: `ls -folders`

#### Implementation

In our GUI, we would like to display the list of folders that users can create to organize
their contacts into different classes. The implementation is very similar to `PersonListCard` and
`PersonListPanel` for viewing list of contacts.

#### Design considerations

* Alternative 1: 2-row layout
    * Pros: Ability to see additional details of folders and contacts with a small-sized GUI.
    * Cons: Extra effort to scroll down the GUI to look into the details of contacts.
* Alternative 2: 2-column layout
    * Pros: Ability to see both folders and contacts data at a glance without initial scrolling needed
    * Cons: Truncated details of folders and contacts will be displayed due to the small-sized GUI.

Alternative 1 is selected, implemented using additional`StackPane` on top of the existing `StackPane`
for the list of contacts placed vertically. This additional `StackPane` is placed under a `VBox`
component in `MainWindow`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add contacts to folder: `echo INDEX_1 ... INDEX_N >> Folder`

#### Implementation
Contacts are added by updating the `ObservableList` in `UniqueFolderList`.
A new `Folder` object is created containing the new `Person` and replaces the old folder in the `UniqueFolderList`.

#### Design considerations

* Alternative 1: If there is an invalid index, allow adding of contact for the remaining valid index
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Difficult for user to know which contacts have been added into the folder
* Alternative 2: Only allow adding of contacts when all indexes are valid
    * Pros: Easier for user to know which contacts have been added into the folder
    * Cons: Requires more code and effort to ensure all indexes are valid before adding them to folder

Alternative 2 is selected, as it is more user-friendly and intuitive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Locate folders by name: `find -folders`

#### Implementation

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component for the `execute("find -folders CS")` API call.

![FindFoldersSequenceDiagram](images/FindFoldersSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

When deciding on the design for `find -folders`, we considered the existing `find` command to search for contacts by name. This `find` command uses `StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase` which only matches full words.

However, one use case we wanted to cater to was students who group their contacts by shared modules. For example, students take CS2103T and CS2101 concurrently, and may wish to search for these two folders (and other CS modules) by using the keyword `CS`. If we only matched full words, `find -folders CS` would not contain *either* of the modules `CS2103T` or `CS2101`, which is undesirable.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Match partial words
    * Pros: More intuitive behaviour for the above use case
    * Cons: Requires a new method to be implemented
* **Alternative 2**: Match full words only
    * Pros: Easy to implement as this uses the same logic as finding contacts by name
    * Cons: May lead to unexpected behaviour for the above use case

Alternative 1 was chosen, and the new method is under `StringUtil.containsTextIgnoreCase`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit folder name: `mv OLD_FOLDER_NAME | NEW_FOLDER_NAME`

#### Implementation

Folders are removed by first specifying the old folder's name and followed
by the new folder's name.

The underlying implementation essentially creates a new folder with the
newly specified name and copies all the contacts from the old to the new
folder. The new folder is saved in the `UniqueFolderList` in `AddressBook`
just like the old folder.

The following diagram shows how `mv` works:

![EditFolderNameSequenceDiagram](images/EditFolderNameSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Old folder and new folder name are separated by the pipe operator `|`.
    * Pros: Easy to distinguish between the folder to be replaced and the new incoming folder name considering how folder name can have blank spaces in between
    * Cons: More difficult to implement

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* computing student with prior experience in using Unix-commands

### Value Proposition

- manage contacts faster and more conveniently than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
- use a set of Unix-like commands that CS students are already familiar with so that they don't have to re-learn, thus helping ease of adoption
- skills learned while using this app are transferable to other tools

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.
      
### Managing contacts

#### Adding a contact: `touch`

1. Creating a contact
    1. Test case: `touch -n John Doe -p 98765432 -e johnd@example.com -a John street, block 123, #01-01`<br>
    Expected: John Doe is added
    1. Test case: `touch -n John Doe -p 98765432 -e johnd@example.com -a John street, block 123, #01-01`<br>
    Expected: John Doe is not added as he is already in the list. Error message is shown.
    1. Test case: `touch -nBetsy Doe -p 98765432 -e johnd@example.com -a John street, block 123, #01-01`<br>
    Expected: Betsy Doe is not added as the command is invalid (due to the lack of a space after the `-n` flag). Error message is shown.

## **Appendix: Effort**

The effort we put into UNIon was more than that of the individual project.
While we did not have to start from scratch, since it is a brown-field project, there were more things that
we had to do. One of the additional challenges were creating our scope, generating user
stories and coming up with what our product would look like. Creating readable, succinct
documentation was also challenging. Weekly meetings also took up more of our time, compared
to the individual project. Moreover, we had internal deadlines to meet, putting 
our time management to the test. Our team did a good job of delegating work and
each person had their role to play. Each member took responsibility for one part of UNIon
and had secondary responsibilities as well. 

UNIon does reuse some code from AB3 when implementing folders. However, it was not 
just a simple copy and paste. Because of the differing behaviours of folders and 
contacts, the code had to be adapted to quite a large extent to suit our purposes.
For folders, only about 5% of the effort was saved by reusing the code from AB3.
This mostly came in the form of saving time and effort from typing out the code and
understanding how the different components interact with models like `Person`. Since
`Folder` is a model as well, the `Person` served as an example to help us understand 
how the models interacted with other components. However, the code from `Person` merely 
served as the base. The difference in behaviour of folders and contacts meant that we had 
to come up with the rest of the code involving the behaviour of folders ourselves.

UNIon deals with more entities than AB3, with both contacts and folders. Not only does
this make coding more difficult, testing is more difficult as well. The GUI of UNIon
includes the display of folders as well. It was more difficult to ensure that UNIon
runs smoothly with more entities present, creating more chances for bugs to sneak in.
