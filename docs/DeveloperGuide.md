### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/edrecord/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/edrecord/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/edrecord/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/edrecord/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/edrecord/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `EdRecordParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `EdRecordParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `EdRecordParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/edrecord/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

<img src="images/ModuleSystemModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores EdRecord data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query that is under the selected module) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
  - to achieve this, 2 separate predicates are used: one that filters for the selected module and one that filters for the results of the search query
  - the resulting filtered list is hence the logical conjunction of these two predicates
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- stores ModuleSystem data i.e., all `Module` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueModuleList` object).
    - all `Module` objects contain a GroupSystem which stores `Group` objects (i.e. classes) in a `UniqueGroupList`
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `EdRecord`, which `Person` references. This allows `EdRecord` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/edrecord/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both EdRecord data, ModuleSystem data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `EdRecordStorage`, `ModuleSystemStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.edrecord.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### ModuleSet
The ModuleSet is a HashSet of modules designed for a Person to hold.
Additionally, it is important in the implementation of the following commands:

- MoveCommand - Add a module and group from a selected person's module set.
- RemoveCommand - Remove a module and group from a selected person's module set.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the ModuleSet will behave:

**Step 1. The user creates a new person, and inputs a module and group.**
The ModuleSystem checks if the module and specific group in the module exists. The application will then add the Group into the Module's GroupSystem, and place the Module into the Person's ModuleSet.

**Step 2. The user adds the person to another group, with same module**
The ModuleSystem checks if the module and specific group in the module exists in the system. The application then checks if ModuleSet contains the module. It then adds the Group to the Module's GroupSystem.

<img src="images/MoveCommandDiagram.png" width="300" />


**Step 3. The user removes person from a group, in a module**
The ModuleSystem checks if the module and specific group in the module exists in the system. The application then checks if ModuleSet contains the module. It then removes the Group from the Module's GroupSystem. After that, the application checks if the GroupSystem is empty. If it is, remove the Module from the ModuleSet too.

<img src="images/RemoveCommandDiagram.png" width="250" />

Alternate implentation: ModuleSet as a HashMap between Modules and a List of Groups.
However, this implementation was passed over, as this would not be utilizing the Module's own GroupSystem. The GroupSystem should be utilized as the single source of truth, and having 2 lists of Groups for 1 single Module would be very confusing and error-prone.

### Representing assignments in a module

A module's assignments are stored in a `UniqueAssignmentList` under the module. Each assignment has a name, a weightage, a maximum score, and a unique ID. The first three fields are supplied by the user, whereas the ID is auto-generated by EdRecord. Assignments are differentiated using their names - the `UniqueAssignmentList` ensures that no two assignments have the same name, case-insensitive. Both assignment name and ID are unique inside the module only, i.e. two different modules can both have a `Lab` assignment with ID `3`, but this is not allowed for the same module.

The unique constraint for assignment name comes from the observation that no two assignments should have the same name in a module (for example, it does not make much sense to have two `Final` assessments for one module). An ID field is given to each assignment upon creation, to make it easier for users to specify the target assignment when adding/deleting student grades. So instead of typing out the entire assignment name, the user can input `id/3` to add grade to assignment with ID `3`.

### Creating assignments

To demonstrate the implementation of assignment-related commands, let's analyze `MakeAssignmentCommand`:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `mkasg n/PE w/5 s/10` Command](images/MakeAssignmentSequenceDiagram.png)

With input `mkasg n/PE w/5 s/10`, the parser classes create a `MakeAssignmentCommand` containing an `Assignment`. This command is executed, instructing the `Model` to add the new assignment to the currently selected module.

![Interactions Inside the Model Component for the `mkasg n/PE w/5 s/10` Command](images/MakeAssignmentSequenceDiagramRef.png)

Inside `Model`, `selected` is the Module that the user is currently in. `selected` receives the new assignment, and calls `add()` on its internal `UniqueAssignmentList` to add in the assignment. There is a check for duplicate assignments through `UniqueAssignmentList#contains`. Finally, `selected` resets the search filter to show all of its student contacts.

**Design considerations:**

- **Alternative 1**: Store assignments under Group.

  - Pros: User is able to create tailored assignment for each group under a module, i.e. assignments that apply on the group level, not the module level.
  - Cons: More memory usage - many assignments such as Midterm, Practical exam, and Final are on the module level, but in this implementation, each group has to store a copy of the assignment. Prone to errors - the user must create/delete/edit many times when they want to make a change to such an assignment, but they can make mistakes when repeating the task. This process is also likely to be very inconvenient to the user.

- **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Store assignments under Module.

  - Pros: Easier to implement. Better experience for user, who can `cd` into the module and use one command `mkasg` to create an assignment. In contrast, if the assignments are under groups, the user has to `cd` into the module and choose a group, before he/she can work with the assignments. This also adds another layer to the `cd` command, which must possibly handle `cd`-ing into a group.
  - Cons: Not able to create assignments on the group level.

### Creating and managing modules
Created modules are stored in a `ModuleSystem` under the model. Each module has a module code, a `GroupSystem` to store classes under the module and a `UniqueAssignmentList` to store assignments under the module.
Modules are differentiated using their module code -- the `UniqueModuleList` ensures that no two modules have the same module code.

To create a module, the user has to provide a valid module code (unique from current existing modules). To delete a module, the user has to provide a valid module code (existing module with same module code).

**Design considerations:**

- **Alternative 1**: Each student stores a module code.

    - Pros: Simpler implementation. More flexibility for user.
    - Cons: Increases chance of errors when saving students. If large number of students, will be difficult to find missing students with wrong module code.

- **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Store assignments under Module.

    - Pros: Creating valid modules to add students to prevents a student getting lost in the system.
    - Cons: Less flexibility for user.

### Create and manage classes
Created classes are stored in a `GroupSystem` under a module. Each class has a class code.
Classes are differentiated using their class code -- the `UniqueGroupList` ensures that no two classes have the same class code in the same `GroupSystem` (i.e. in the same module).

To create a class, the user has to provide a valid class code (unique from current existing classes in the module). To delete a module, the user has to provide a valid class code (existing class with same class code in the module).

**Design considerations:**

- **Alternative 1**: A separate `GroupSystem` under model, together with `ModuleSystem`.

    - Pros: Easy to implement.
    - Cons: More complicated to save and load. Less OOP.

- **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: A `GroupSystem` under a module.

    - Pros: Simple to save and load. More OOP-oriented and instinctive to understand.
    
### Assign students grades for assignments

A command for grading assignments was added: `grade INDEX id/ASSIGNMENT ID st/STATUS [s/SCORE]`. This command allows the user to assign a Grade object to a student. The user can delete grades using the command `dlgrade INDEX id/ASSIGNMENT ID`.

The `grade` command parses the user's input into a valid `Grade` object, then retrieves the assignment from the current module using the assignment's unique `id`. Since assignments are linked to a specific module, the user must `cd` into a module before using the `grade` command.

Within each `Person` object, there is an `AssignmentGradeMap` that keeps track of the student's assignments and their respective grade. 
Internally, `AssignmentGradeMap` is implemented using a `HashMap` of `Assignments` mapped to `Grades`.


#### `Grade` object

The `Grade` object contains the completion status of the assignment (Not submitted, Submitted, Graded) and optionally the score that the student has achieved.

The user must choose from the three available completion status only. Additionally, if the completion status is "Graded", the user can choose to also assign the student a score. If the completion status is "Not submitted" or "Submitted", a score cannot be assigned to the student.

#### Design considerations:

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store grades under students.
  - Pros: More intuitive to implement. From an OOP point of view, it makes more sense for students' grades to be stored under the Person object.
  - Cons: More difficult to implement deletion of assignments, as the delete command needs to iterate through every person in the module to remove grades.

- **Alternative 2:** Store grades under assignments.
  - Pros: Easier to implement deletion, as grades can be stored under individual assignments and the entire assignment can be deleted.
  - Cons: Difficult to implement creation and storage of grades, as it is difficult to maintain an association between `Person` objects and `Assignment` objects, especially when students' details are edited.

### \[Proposed\] Separate view for assignments 

#### Proposed Implementation

A new command will be added: `view [asg/info]`. This command toggles the view between assignments and the default contact list.

#### Assignment View

This view will be optimized for verifying and grading assignments. 

### Contact List View

This is the current view of the app. This is optimized to display contact details.

1. Test case: With a module selected, with the assignment to grade having ID 1 and max score 100, and the student to grade having index 1, `grade 1 id/1 st/Graded s/90`

    Expected: The grade of the student is updated, with status Graded and score 90.

2. Test case: Same as 1, but with assignment has max score 10
   
    Expected: The console displays an error, reminding the user that the grade exceeds the maximum score of the assignment

3. Test case: Same as 1, but with an invalid status such as `st/Late`
   
    Expected: The console displays an error, reminding the user of the valid statuses. 

### Deleting a grade

1. Test case: With a module selected, with the graded assignment having ID 2 and the student having index 1, `dlgrade 1 id/2`

    Expected: The grade of the student is removed.

3. Test case: Same as 1, but with an invalid assignment ID or person index

    Expected: The console displays an error, reminding the user of the valid format.

### Deleting an assignment

1. Test case: With a module selected, and an assignment to delete of ID 1, `dlasg 1`

    Expected: The assignment is deleted.

### Deleting a class

1. Test case: With the module `CS2103` selected, and an existing class of `T03`, `dlclass m/cs2103 c/t03`

    Expected: The class is deleted.

2. Test case: Same as 1, but with an nonexistent module/class

    Expected: The console displays an error, with relevant information.

### Deleting a module

1. Test case: With the module to delete having a code of `CS2103`, `dlmod CS2103`

    Expected: The module is deleted.

2. Test case: Same as 1, but with an nonexistent module

    Expected: The console displays an error, with relevant information.

### Deleting a person

1. Test case: With the person to delete in index 1, `delete 1`

    Expected: The person in index 1 will be deleted, with details of the deleted contact in the console. The list is updated to reflect the deleted person.

2. Test case: `delete 0`

    Expected: The console displays an error, reminding the user of a valid index.

3. Test case: `delete 100`

    Expected: The console displays an error, reminding the user that the provided index is invalid.

### Clearing all data

1. Test case: `clear`

    Expected: EdRecord is cleared of all data. You can verify this with the respective list commands.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

  1. Test case: Missing JSON file.
  
      Expected: Sample data will be populated on startup.

  2. Test case: Corrupted JSON file.

      Expected: An empty instance of EdRecord will be started, with more detailed error message logged.

## Effort 
In general, our team has managed to implement the essential features of the applications to allow EdRecord to become a usable application. Our team closely adhered towards the given deadlines, making sure that each of the important features were done by a specific milestone. The enhancements made on top of AddressBook-3 is equal or slightly more than our individual projects.

### **Challenges Encountered:**
1. Closely associated objects
    - EdRecord has ModuleSystem, Module, Group, ModuleSet, Assignments and Grades. Compared to AB3, with a `Person` object containing many fields, their nature made them deeply nested. This made their creation, deletion and manipulating them very tedious, and contributed to most of the bugs found in the dry run. This was eventually solved having multiple checks at each command.

2. Closely associated objects (2)
    - As they are closely coupled together, writing tests for multiple classes together is more difficult. Furthermore, our team did not have enough time to write tests for every single new component.

### **Achievements Accomplished:**
1. Different selection and views
    - EdRecord implemented the ability to change views between contacts and assignments, and also having the ability to select modules. This was a big change from AddressBook-3, needing new UI, and also having the ability to quickly swap from view to view.
