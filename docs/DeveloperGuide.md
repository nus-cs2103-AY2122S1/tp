### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2122s1_cs2103t_w16_2/btbb/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2122s1_cs2103t_w16_2/btbb/MainApp.java).
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `delete-c 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2122s1_cs2103t_w16_2/btbb/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `HomeTab`,
`StatTab` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the
commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

There are 2 main tab panes contained in `MainWindow`:
* `HomeTab`: Displays all the orders, client bookmarks and recipe bookmarks.
* `StatTab`: Displays all the ingredients and also business statistics such as revenue for each month, top 10 most
  frequent clients and top 10 most popular recipes

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that  are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2122s1_cs2103t_w16_2/btbb/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2122s1_cs2103t_w16_2/btbb/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteClientCommand`)
   which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.
1. Lastly the `LogicManager` communicates with `Storage` to save the changes.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-c 1")`
API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteClientSequenceDiagram.png)

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddOrderCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to
  parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddOrderCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser`
  returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddOrderCommandParser`, `DeleteOrderCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the
  `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2122s1_cs2103t_w16_2/btbb/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores the application data in the following components:
  * a `UniqueClientList` containing `Client` objects.
  * a `UniqueIngredientList` containing `Ingredient` objects.
  * a `UniqueOrderList` containing `Order` objects.
  * a `UniqueRecipeList` containing `Recipe` objects.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>`, `ObservableList<Ingredient>`, `ObservableList<Order>` and
  `ObservableList<Recipe>` which can be observed by the UI. This allows the UI to automatically update the displayed
  list when the data in the list is modified.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (`Ui`, `Logic`, `Storage`).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2122s1_cs2103t_w16_2/btbb/storage/Storage.java)

![StorageClassDiagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save both application data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `ay2122s1_cs2103t_w16_2.btbb.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### Overview

Add operations can be executed for the following entities: clients, orders, ingredients and recipes.

#### Mechanism

This is how the add mechanism works in general:

1. User enters an add command.
1. A relevant `AddXCommandParser`, where `X` is one of the entities, parses the command to generate a `AddXCommand`.
1. The `AddXCommandParser` generates a relevant `XDescriptor` that contains the details of the entity `X` to be created.
1. The `AddXCommand` is executed. During execution, the `XDescriptor` is converted to its respective `X` entity.
1. `Model` adds the entity.
1. `Storage` saves the changes.
1. Feedback about the status of the add is shown to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add order operation works. The sequence diagram for other
entities (client, ingredient and recipe) in the model is similar. However, for add order,
there is an additional optional step of subtracting the ingredient quantities for each matching ingredient in
the inventory.

![AddOrderSequenceDiagram](images/AddOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Usage scenarios

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add order command:

![AddOrderActivityDiagram](images/AddOrderActivityDiagram.png)

Example of a successful addition using the add order command:

1. The user wishes to add an order.
1. The user executes an appropriate add order command to add an order. The `commandText` is received by
   `MainWindow#executeCommand()` and the above mechanism occurs.
1. The app adds the order and the order is shown in the list.

### Copy bookmark details to order feature

#### Overview

Copy operations can be executed for the following entities: clients and recipes. Instead of keying in all the
details of a client when adding an order, the user can specify the index of the client displayed in the client list
to copy over the details of the client to the order. This can also be done for recipes.

Example:
* With both client and recipe index `add-o c/1 r/3 od/12-12-2021 1800 oq/2`

#### Mechanism

This is how the copy mechanism works in general:
1. User enters an add order command using `X` index where `X` is one of the entities.
1. A relevant `AddOrderCommandParser` parses the command to generate a `AddOrderCommand`.
1. The `AddOrderCommand` is executed.
1. `Model` gets `X` from `X` list using the specified index.
1. Details of `X` is copied into the order.
1. `Model` adds the order.
1. `Storage` saves the changes.
1. Feedback about the status of the addition is shown to the user.

The sequence diagram is similar to the add feature.

#### Usage scenarios

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add order command using a client index.
The activity diagram for adding an order using a recipe index is similar.

![CopyClientBookmarkDetailsToOrderActivityDiagram](images/CopyClientBookmarkDetailsToOrderActivityDiagram.png)

Example of a successful addition using the add order command using a client index:

1. The user wishes to add an order for the first client in the displayed client list.
1. The user executes `add-o c/1 rn/Chicken Rice od/12-12-2021 1800 op/4.00 oq/2` The `commandText` is received by
   `MainWindow#executeCommand()` and the above mechanism occurs.
1. The app adds an order containing the details of the first client and the order is shown in the list.

### Delete feature

#### Overview

Delete operations can be executed for the following entities: clients, orders, ingredients and recipes.

#### Mechanism

This is how the delete mechanism works in general:
1. User enters a delete command.
1. A relevant `DeleteXCommandParser`, where `X` is one of the entities, parses the command to generate a
   `DeleteXCommand`.
1. The `DeleteXCommand` is executed.
1. `Model` deletes the entity.
1. `Storage` saves the changes.
1. Feedback about the status of the delete is shown to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete order operation works. The sequence diagram for other
entities (client, ingredient and recipe) in the model is similar. However, for delete order, there is an additional
optional step of adding ingredient quantities back to matching ingredients in the inventory.

![DeleteOrderSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Usage scenarios

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete order command:

![DeleteOrderActivityDiagram](images/DeleteOrderActivityDiagram.png)

Example of a successful deletion using the delete order command:

1. The user wishes to delete the first order in the list.
1. The user executes `delete-o 1` command to delete the first order. The `commandText` is received by
   `MainWindow#executeCommand()` and the above mechanism occurs.
1. The app deletes the order and the order is no longer shown in the list.

### Edit feature

#### Overview

Edit operations can be executed for the following entities: clients, orders, ingredients and recipes.

#### Mechanism

This is how the edit mechanism works in general:

1. User enters an edit command.
1. A relevant `EditXCommandParser`, where `X` is one of the entities, parses the command to generate a `EditXCommand`.
1. The `EditXCommandParser` generates a relevant `XDescriptor` that contains the details of the entity `X` to be edited.
1. The `EditXCommand` is executed. During execution, the `XDescriptor` is converted to its respective `X` entity.
1. `Model` updates the entity.
1. `Storage` saves the changes.
1. Feedback about the status of the edit is shown to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit order operation works. The sequence diagram for other
entities (client, ingredient and recipe) in the model is similar. However, for edit order,
there is an additional optional step of adding/subtracting the ingredient quantities for each matching ingredient in
the inventory when there is a change in order quantity.

![EditOrderSequenceDiagram](images/EditOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Usage scenarios

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an edit order command:

![EditOrderActivityDiagram](images/EditOrderActivityDiagram.png)

Example of a successful edit using the edit order command:

1. The user wishes to edit an order.
1. The user executes an appropriate edit order command to edit an order. The `commandText` is received by
   `MainWindow#executeCommand()` and the above mechanism occurs.
1. The app edits the order and the order is shown in the list.

### Edit ingredients in order/ recipe feature

#### Overview
Each order and recipe can contain a list of ingredients.
The list is edited through add and delete operations.

#### Mechanism - Add order/ recipe ingredient

This is how the mechanism works in general:

1. User enters an add ingredient command.
1. A relevant `AddXIngredientCommandParser`, where `X` is either `Order` or `Recipe`, parses the command to generate a `AddXIngredientCommand`.
1. The `AddXIngredientCommand` is executed.
1. The new ingredient is added to a copy of the ingredients list of the specified order or recipe, forming a new ingredients list.
1. `Model` updates the order or recipe with the new ingredients list.
1. `Storage` saves the changes.
1. Feedback about the status of the addition is shown to the user.

The sequence diagram is similar to the edit feature.

#### Mechanism - Delete order/ recipe ingredient

This is how the mechanism works in general:

1. User enters a delete ingredient command.
1. A relevant `DeleteXIngredientCommandParser`, where `X` is either `Order` or `Recipe`, parses the command to generate a `DeleteXIngredientCommand`.
1. The `DeleteXIngredientCommand` is executed.
1. A copy of the ingredients list of the specified order or recipe is made and the specified ingredient is removed.
1. `Model` updates the order or recipe with the new ingredients list.
1. `Storage` saves the changes.
1. Feedback about the status of the deletion is shown to the user.

The sequence diagram is similar to the edit feature.

#### Usage Scenario - Add order/ recipe ingredient

Example of a successful addition of ingredient using the add recipe ingredient command:

1. The user wishes to add an ingredient to a recipe in the list.
1. The user executes `add-ri 1 in/Rice iq/400 iu/g` command to add 400 grams of Rice to the first recipe. The `commandText` is received by
   `MainWindow#executeCommand()` and the above mechanism occurs.
1. The app adds the ingredient to the recipe and the edited recipe is displayed.

![AddRecipeIngredientActivityDiagram](images/AddRecipeIngredientActivityDiagram.png)

#### Usage Scenario - Delete order/ recipe ingredient

Example of a successful deletion of ingredient using the delete recipe ingredient command:

1. The user wishes to delete an ingredient from a recipe in the list.
1. The user executes `delete-ri 1 i/2` command to delete the second ingredient from the first recipe. The `commandText` is received by
   `MainWindow#executeCommand()` and the above mechanism occurs.
1. The app deletes the ingredient from the recipe and the edited recipe is displayed.

![DeleteRecipeIngredientActivityDiagram](images/DeleteRecipeIngredientActivityDiagram.png)

### Find feature

#### Overview

Find operations can be executed for all entity types in the model, ie.
clients, orders, ingredients and recipes.

#### Mechanism

The find mechanism is facilitated by 4 generic classes that implement the
Java `Predicate` interface. The 4 classes are `PredicateCollection`,
`StringContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `ValueInListPredicate` and
`ValueWithinRangePredicate`. All of these classes are generic so that their
functionality can be reused for all entity types. The purposes of these classes
are as follows:
* `StringContainsKeywordsPredicate` - Tests if a field in an object matches
  any of the keywords provided by the user. This class can perform partial and
  case-insensitive matches.

* `ValueInListPredicate` - Tests if a value of a field in an object
  exists in the list of values provided by the user.

* `ValueWithinRangePredicate` - Tests if a value of a field in an object
  is within a range of values provided by the user.

* `PredicateCollection` - Tests if an object satisfies all the predicates
  contained in this class. This class enables finding entities based on
  multiple search criteria.

#### Usage Scenario

1. The user executes the `find-i in/avo gin iqf/1 iqt/10` command to find ingredients whose name matches
   the keywords 'avo' or 'gin' and whose quantities are from the range 1-10.

2. The `FindIngredientCommandParser` parses the command into `FindIngredientCommand`. A `StringContainsKeywordsPredicate`
   is created with the keywords 'avo' and 'gin'. A `ValueWithinRangePredicate` is created with the start value set to
   '1' and end value set to '10'. Both of these predicates are added to a `PredicateCollection`. A `FindCommand` is
   created with the `PredicateCollection`.

3. The `ModelManager#updateFilteredIngredientList` method gets called with the `PredicateCollection` which causes
   the `FilteredIngredientList` in `ModelManager` to only contain ingredients that match all the find criteria.

4. The `FilteredIngredientList` is a JavaFX `ObservableList` that is observed by the `IngredientListPanel`. The change
   in `FilteredIngredientList` will cause the `IngredientListPanel` to re-render, showing only the ingredients that
   match the find criteria.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation for the above scenario works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

### List feature

#### Overview

List operation can be executed for the following entities: clients, orders, ingredients and recipes.

#### Mechanism
This section explains the List Mechanism:

The list mechanism is facilitated by updating the filtered list in `ModelManager` with the predicate that shows all objects in the specified entity list.

The Filtered List is a JavaFX `ObservableList` that is observed by the respective entity Ui Panel.
Changes made to this list will cause the Ui panel to re-render, showing all objects of the specified entity.

#### Usage Scenario

The following sequence diagram shows how the list order operation works:
![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

Example of a successful outcome using the List command:
1. The user wishes to list all orders in the order list.
1. The user executes `list-o` command to display everything stored in the specified order list. The `commandText` is received by `MainWindow#executeCommand()`.
1. The `ListOrderCommandParser` parses the command into a `ListOrderCommand`, which is passed back to the `Logic` to be executed.
1. The `Logic` Component then executes the command.
1. The Model's `filteredOrderList` will be updated to show all orders.
1. The `CommandResult` created would then be passed to the Ui components, to display the updated order list and result message to the user.
1. The app shows all orders in the order list.

### Statistics feature

#### Overview

Statistics will always be displayed to the user.
The following order operations can be executed to update the statistics:
* add-o
* delete-o
* edit-o (with changes made to recipe price and/or client phone number and client name)

#### Mechanism

This is how the statistics mechanism works in general:

1. User enters any order command that updates statistics.
1. A relevant `XOrderCommandParser`, where `X` is one of the operations, parses the command to generate a `XOrderCommand`.
1. The `XOrderCommand` is executed.
1. `Model` updates the `UniqueOrderList` and `Storage` saves the changes.
1. Feedback about the status of the operation is shown to the user.
1. The relevant data is retrieved from `Model` via `Logic` and passed into a new `StatTabContent` object.
1. `StatTab` which contains the statistic charts, is updated with the contents of the `StatTabContent`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the statistics work:

![StatsSequenceDiagram](images/StatsSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Usage scenarios

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when statistics are updated through an order command:

![StatsActivityDiagram](images/StatsActivityDiagram.png)

Example of a successful update to statistics, by adding an order:

1. The user wishes to add an order.
1. The user executes an appropriate add order command to add an order. The `commandText` is received by
   `MainWindow#executeCommand()` and the above mechanism occurs.
1. The app adds the order and the order is shown in the list.
1. Since the command will update the statistic charts, the new chart data is retrieved from Model.
1. All charts are updated with the new chart data.

### Tab feature

#### Overview
Tabs are switched programmatically in 2 ways:
1. Tab command
1. Executing a command that affects the view of contents in a tab

#### Mechanism
The tab switch mechanism is facilitated by `CommandResult`.
This is because any programmatic tab switch will only occur after the execution of a command
and information about the switch has to be passed to `Ui` components.
After executing a command, if a tab switch should occur,
the tab to switch to is stored in a `CommandResult`.
This `CommandResult` is created in a `Ui` object through `MainWindow#executeCommand()`.
Hence, data about whether there is a tab switch and which tab to switch to
can be passed to `Ui` components and rendered accordingly.

The following sequence diagram shows how the tab operation works:

![TabSequenceDiagram](images/TabSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Usage Scenarios

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a command:

![TabActivityDiagram](images/TabActivityDiagram.png)

Example of a successful switch using the Tab command:
1. The user wishes to switch to the Home tab.
1. The user executes `tab 1` command to switch to the Home tab. The `commandText` is received by `MainWindow#executeCommand()` and the above mechanism occurs.
1. The app shows the Home tab.
