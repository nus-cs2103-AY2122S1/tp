### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/docit/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/docit/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/docit/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/docit/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Patient` object residing in the `Model`.

**Displaying Patient and Appointment Panels**

The main UI parts of the `MainWindow` to display Patient and Appointment information are `PatientListPanel` and
`AppointmentListPanel`, each holding a number of `PatientCard`'s and `AppointmentCard`'s.


![Example of PatientCard](images/PatientCard.png)

In the `PatientCard` part, we can see all the details that we store of the Patient.

![Example of AppointmentCard](images/AppointmentCard.png)

In the `AppointmentCard` part, appointments occurring today have a highlighted '**TODAY**' indicator to help clinic staff
easily identify appointments occurring today. Non-essential patient details are also omitted.

We can also toggle between the **Archive** and **Upcoming** tabs to view Appointments that are upcoming or have been
archived. This is also the reason why `MainWindow` component holds two `AppointmentListPanel`'s - One for
upcoming appointments, and the other for archived appointments.

A multi-panel display is used because the user should be able to look for an Appointment's patient details without
swapping back and forth between the Patient list and Appointments list. The tab display is used as archived appointments are likely
to be referred to less than upcoming ones. The decision to separate the two into two tabs reduces visual clutter significantly
and allows the user to view the more important information immediately.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/docit/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
    - `AddressBookParser` categorises the command according to its format (using RegEx) and hands it off
      to either one of `BasicAddressBookParser`, `PatientBookParser`, or `AppointmentBookParser`.
2. The chosen parser then parses the command and returns a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a patient).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("pt delete 1")` API call. The illustration has been split into two parts: (1) Parse User Input, (2) Execute command.

**Parse User Input**

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `pt delete 1` Command](diagrams/DeletePatientFeatureSequenceDiagram1.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `PatientBookParser` and `DeletePatientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

**Execute command**

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `pt delete 1` Command](diagrams/DeletePatientFeatureSequenceDiagram.png)


Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

[comment]:
![Interactions between Command and Parser](diagrams/ParserClasses.png)

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`, `DeletePatientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from one of the three parser interfaces: `BasicParser`, `PatientParser`, or `AppointmentParser` so that they
  be treated appropriately based on the type of command issued.

* The three types of parsers (`BasicParser`, `PatientParser`, `AppointmentParser`) inherit directly from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

**Breakdown of Commands** <br>
In the original AB3, all commands extend the `Command` abstract class.
`Doc'it` supports three types of commands – general, patient-related, and appointment-related. As such, we introduce three abstract classes `BasicCommand`, `PatientCommand`, and `AppointmentCommand` in place of `Command`.

> As the names suggest, `BasicCommand` deals with whole application-related operations, `PatientCommand` deals with patient-related CRUD operations, and `AppointmentCommand` deal with appointment-related CRUD operations.

The following is a list of commands that extend the three abstract classes:

- `BasicCommand`
    - `ExitCommand`
    - `ClearCommand`
    - `HelpCommand`
- `PatientCommand`
    - `AddPatientCommand`
    - `EditPatientCommand`
    - `DeletePatientCommand`
    - `ListPatientCommand`
    - `FindPatientCommand`
    - `AddMedicalEntryCommandParser`
    - `DeleteMedicalEntryCommandParser`
- `AppointmentCommand`
    - `AddAppointmentCommand`
    - `ArchiveAppointmentCommand`
    - `EditAppointmentCommand`
    - `DeleteAppointmentCommand`
    - `ListAppointmentsCommand`
    - `SortAppointmentsCommand`
    - `AddPrescriptionCommand`
    - `DeletePrescriptionCommand`

> This taxonomy of commands is further reflected on the Parser's side as well.

**Parser** <br>
The `Parser` interface is broken into three sub-interfaces: `BasicParser`, `PatientParser`, and `AppointmentParser`, for the parsers related to application-related commands, patient-related commands, and
appointment-related commands respectively. For all commands under `PatientParser` and `AppointmentParser` (ones that require
any form of extra user input), we have a specific parser that tokenises the command:

- `PatientCommandParser`
    - `AddPatientCommandParser`
    - `EditPatientCommandParser`
    - `DeletePatientCommandParser`
    - `FindPatientCommandParser`
    - `AddMedicalEntryCommandParser`
    - `DeleteMedicalEntryCommandParser`
- `AppointmentParser`
    - `AddAppointmentCommandParser`
    - `EditAppointmentCommandParser`
    - `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser`
    - `AddPrescriptionCommandParser`
    - `DeletePrescriptionCommandParser`

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/docit/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data and appointment book data (both upcoming and archived) i.e., all `Patient`, `Appointment` objects (which are contained in `UniquePatientList` and `UniqueAppointmentList` objects).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Patient` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below.

<img src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/docit/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save address book data, appointment book data, and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `AppointmentBookStorage` and `ArchivedAppointmentBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Medical History

**Class Implementation details**

- The `MedicalHistory` class composes an `EntryList<Entry<MedicalEntry>>` class.
- The `EntryList` class references the `Entry<MedicalEntry>` through an `ArrayList`.
- The `Entry<MedicalEntry>` class is an abstract class that is either a `Some<MedicalEntry>` or an `Empty<Object>` class.
- Each `Patient` class composes exactly one `MedicalHistory` class.
- `MedicalEntry` is an inner static class of `MedicalHistory`
- Each `MedicalEntry` has a `description` data attribute and a `dateOfRecord` data attribute. The `description` data is supplied by the user. The `dateOfRecord` is automatically generated based on the date the medical entry was recorded.

Below is a class diagram illustrating the relationship between `Patient` and `MedicalHistory`. Note: other details within the `Model` component are omitted.

![Class diagram of MedicalHistory](diagrams/MedicalHistoryClassDiagram.png)


**Design Considerations**

| Alternative Considered | Current implementation | Rationale for current implementation |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Using a list of medical entries as an attribute of a `Patient` class | Multiple or zero `MedicalEntry` objects can be stored by a single `MedicalHistory`. Each `Patient` class has exactly one `MedicalHistory` reference.         | ```Patient``` and ```MedicalHistory``` share a whole-part relationship: when a ```Patient``` object is destroyed, the corresponding ```MedicalHistory``` object is also destroyed. If the `Patient` does not have any medical records, this means that the `MedicalHistory` is empty, which is reflected by a single `EMPTY_MEDICAL_HISTORY` (instantiation of a `MedicalHistory` object with an `EntryList<Entry<MedicalEntry>>` containing exactly one `Entry` that is an `Empty`). Hence, there is a 1...1 multiplicity relationship between ```Patient``` and ```MedicalHistory```, as one patient can have exactly one medical history. Following OOP Principles, it is more apt to encapsulate medical history records (or medical entries) as a `MedicalHistory` class than using a collection of medical entries, e.g. `List<MedicalEntry>`. |
| Using `null` to reflect an empty `MedicalHistory` for patients that do not have any recorded medical history | An empty `MedicalHistory` object is instantiated (`EMPTY_MEDICAL_HISTORY`), and this object is referenced in every `Patient` object that does not have any medical history records.       | It is not a mistake for a patient to have zero medical history records. If we were to use `null` to reflect an empty medical history, there would be many scenarios where by running a blanket command on a patient, `NullPointerException` would be thrown at runtime if we do not check for `null`. Hence, as part of our defensive programming efforts, we created a single `EMPTY_MEDICAL_HISTORY` object that is an instantiation of a `MedicalHistory` object with an `EntryList<Entry<MedicalEntry>>` containing exactly one `Entry` that is an `Empty`. This allows us to bypass `NullPointerException` due to the additional null safety built in and exploit polymorphism.|
| Using the `Optional` interface to reflect an `Entry` | `Entry` class is implemented to reflect an `Entry` that is either `Some` or `Empty`, such that all `null` or `empty` inputs into the factory `of` method generate an `Entry.Empty`, and every other input generates an `Entry.Some`     | When the `Optional::of` takes in `null`, a runtime exception is thrown. But `null` is a valid input. While `Optional` provides an `ofNullable` method, we wanted to take an active defensive programming approach. We thus constructed the `Entry` class, whereby there is only one factory `of` method, where `null` inputs are taken care of. |
| Using the `List` interface to reflect a list of entries | `EntryList` class is implemented to reflect an `EntryList` that contains the `Entry` | We want to limit the methods available for an `EntryList` to only `add`, `delete`, `size`, `get`, `toStream`. Each `Entry` and their position within the `EntryList` should not be modifiable. After all, at our current stage of production, we do not want the `MedicalEntry` to have a different order from their time of input. Iterator functions of the `List` interface allow for modification of contents of an `Entry` at a specified position in the `List`, which violates this invariant. As part of defensive programming, we thus chose to create an `EntryList` class that exposes only the immutable functions of a `List`.|
| Having `MedicalEntry` as a separate class from `MedicalHistory` | `MedicalEntry` is an inner static class of `MedicalHistory`     | A `MedicalEntry` can only exist if there is a `MedicalHistory`. There should be no instantiation of a `MedicalEntry` without a `MedicalHistory` instantiated. We also do not want `MedicalEntry` to implement any interface that `MedicalHistory` does not. Thus, we opted to have `MedicalEntry` as an inner class of `MedicalHistory`. |

#### Add Medical Entry feature

**Overview**

The Add Medical Entry feature allows users to add medical entries into the `MedicalHistory` of a `Patient`. Each new `MedicalEntry` must have the data field `description`, which is the description of the medical record (e.g. `diabetes`).

Below is a class diagram of the components involved in the Add Medical Entry feature.

![Class diagram of Add Medical Entry Feature](diagrams/AddMedicalEntryFeatureClassDiagram.png)

**Implementation details of feature**

The Add Medical Entry feature is implemented via the `AddMedicalEntryCommand`, which is supported by the `AddMedicalEntryCommandParser`. The `AddMedicalEntryCommandParser` implements the `PatientParser` interface.
1. `LogicManager` receives the user input which is parsed by the `AddressBookParser`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the `PatientBookParser` based on the regex pattern of the user input, splitting the user input into `commandWord` and `arguments`.
3. The `PatientBookParser` invokes the `AddMedicalEntryCommandParser` based on the `commandWord`, calling the method `parsePatientCommand` with `arguments` as the method argument.
4. `AddMedicalEntryCommandParser` takes in the argument string and invokes an `ArgumentMultiMap`, which tokenizes the `arguments`.
5. If the required `preamble` and `PREFIX_MEDICAL` is present, the `AddMedicalEntryCommandParser` will invoke the `AddMedicalEntryCommand` after calling the `parseMedicalHistory` method provided by `ParserUtil`, which returns a `MedicalHistory` based on the `description` data field. The `preamble` identifies the `Index` of the `Patient` to add the medical entry to, while the string after `PREFIX_MEDICAL` specifies the `description` data field required for adding a new `MedicalEntry`.
6. `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of the `AddMedicalEntryCommand`, which calls the `addMedicalHistory` of the `Patient` specified by the `Index`.
7. The `AddMedicalEntryCommand` will then call the methods `setPatient`, `updateAppointmentBook`, `updateFilteredPatientList` and `updateFilteredAppointmentList` provided by the `Model`, editing the patient's medical history information.
8. The `AddMedicalEntryCommand` returns a `CommandResult`, which will be returned to the `LogicManager`.

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components when the user inputs `pt ma 1 m/diabetes` command. Note that the full command string has been abbreviated to `...`. The illustration has been split into two parts: (1) Parse User Input, (2) Execute command.

**Parse User Input**

**Execute a:AddMedicalEntryCommand**

The following activity diagram summarises what happens within `AddMedicalEntryCommandParser` when the user executes an Add Medical Entry command.

![Activity diagram of Add Medical Entry Feature](diagrams/AddMedicalEntryFeatureActivityDiagram.png)

**Design considerations**

| Alternative Considered | Current implementation | Rationale for current implementation |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Implementing a `MedicalHistoryBookParser` to invoke the `AddMedicalEntryCommandParser` | Having `PatientBookParser` invoke `AddMedicalEntryCommandParser`  | Since `MedicalHistory` is an attribute of `Patient`, it makes sense to use the `PatientBookParser`. It also takes more effort to implement a new `Parser` that requires an entirely new command word prefix to add a `MedicalEntry`. |


#### Delete Medical Entry feature

**Overview**

The Delete Medical Entry feature allows users to delete medical entries from the `MedicalHistory` of a `Patient`.

Below is a class diagram of the components involved in the Delete Medical Entry feature.

![Class diagram of Delete Medical Entry Feature](diagrams/DeleteMedicalEntryFeatureClassDiagram.png)

**Implementation details of feature**

The Delete Medical Entry feature is implemented via the `DeleteMedicalEntryCommand`, which is supported by the `DeleteMedicalEntryCommandParser`. The `DeleteMedicalEntryCommandParser` implements the `PatientParser` interface.
1. `LogicManager` receives the user input which is parsed by the `AddressBookParser`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the `PatientBookParser` based on the regex pattern of the user input, splitting the user input into `commandWord` and `arguments`.
3. The `PatientBookParser` invokes the `DeleteMedicalEntryCommandParser` based on the `commandWord`, calling the method `parsePatientCommand` with `arguments` as the method argument.
4. `DeleteMedicalEntryCommandParser` takes in the argument string and invokes an `ArgumentMultiMap`, which tokenizes the `arguments`.
5. If the required `patientIndex` and `medicalIndex` is present, the `DeleteMedicalEntryCommandParser` will invoke the `DeleteMedicalEntryCommand` after calling the `parseIndex` method provided by `ParserUtil`, which returns an `Index` to specify the `patient` and the `medicalEntry` to be deleted.
6. `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of the `DeleteMedicalEntryCommand`, which calls the `deleteMedicalHistory` of the `Patient` specified by the `Index`.
7. The `DeleteMedicalEntryCommand` will then call the methods `setPatient`, `updateAppointmentBook`, `updateFilteredPatientList` and `updateFilteredAppointmentList` provided by the `Model`, editing the patient's medical history information.
8. The `DeleteMedicalEntryCommand` returns a `CommandResult`, which will be returned to the `LogicManager`.

Below is a sequence diagram illustrating the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components when the user inputs `pt md 1 i/1` command. Note that the full command string has been abbreviated to `...`. The illustration has been split into two parts: (1) Parse User Input, (2) Execute command.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens within `DeleteMedicalEntryCommandParser` when the user executes a DeleteMedicalEntry command.

**Design Considerations**

| Alternative Considered | Current implementation | Rationale for current implementation |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Implementing a `MedicalHistoryBookParser` to invoke the `DeleteMedicalEntryCommandParser` | Having `PatientBookParser` invoke `DeleteMedicalEntryCommandParser`  | Since `MedicalHistory` is an attribute of `Patient`, it makes sense to use the `PatientBookParser`. It also takes more effort to implement a new `Parser` that requires an entirely new command word prefix to delete a `MedicalEntry`. |



### Appointment composed of a Valid Patient when added, loaded and stored

#### How Appointment is implemented

![AppointmentClassDiagram](images/AppointmentClassDiagram.png)

Each `Appointment` in memory contains a reference to a valid `Patient` object. To ensure this valid reference is maintained while the app is running and between different running instances, `Appointment` is stored in JSON with the index of the `Patient` in the corresponding `AddressBook`.

Major changes involved to implement this feature:
* Add a new appointment
* Load appointments on app launch
* Save appointments after every command
* Delete a patient that has made an appointment

#### Add a new Appointment

**Overview**

`AddAppointmentCommand#execute()` gets patient at the given index in the address book to create a new appointment referencing that patient.

**Detailed Implementation**

The user executes `apmt add i/1 d/2021-10-19 1800` to add an appointment to the first patient of the address book. The `apmt add` command calls `Model#getFilteredPatientList()`to receive a list of patients and gets the Patient object at the inputted index. A new Appointment of that patient is instantiated, and the `AddAppointmentCommand` calls `Model#addAppointment()` to add this appointment to the appointment book. A `CommandResult` is instantiated and returned.

![AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)


**Design considerations**

**Aspect: How Appointments are instantiated**

| Design Choice | Justification | Pros | Cons |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Appointment is composed of a Patient (current choice)** | Appointment can only be instantiated with a Patient, and without Patients, Appointments cannot exist. Hence, for an appointment to be instantiated, it requires a reference to the related Patient object. | <ui><li>Enforces 1 multiplicity requiring one Appointment to be associated with exactly one Patient.</li> <li>Easy to find the patient of the appointment.</li></ui>| Need to locate corresponding Patient before Appointment can be instantiated. Thus, `AddressBook` must be loaded to memory before `AppointmentBook`. |
| Patient and Appointment have an association such that Patient has a link to Appointment and Appointment only requires date and time to instantiate. | - | Able to load `AppointmentBook` without loaded `AddressBook`. | <ui><li>Appointments may not be unique objects as there may be patients with multiple appointments at the same date and time at the same clinic that can be served by different doctors.</li><li> Difficult to find Patient of each Appointment when Appointment is extracted from Patients and listed because Appointment has no Patient field.</li></ui> |


#### Load Appointments on App Launch

**Overview**

* The app first loads address book, then passes the address book as argument to `Storage#readAppointmentBook()`.
* `Storage#readAppointmentBook()` gets the corresponding patient from the patient index in `JSONAdaptedAppointments` and instantiates appointments.

**Detailed Implementation**

The user launches the application. `MainApp` runs `MainApp#initModelManager` to initialize the model. First, the address book of patients is loaded to memory in `StorageManager#readAddressBook()`. Referencing the order of patients in this loaded address book, `StorageManager#readAppointmentBook()` loads the appointment book. Under `Storage`, the JSON file is loaded to `JsonAdaptedAppointment` object and its `JsonAdaptedAppointment#toModelType()` is executed. `JsonAdaptedAppointment#toModelType()` runs `AddressBook#getPatientOfIndex()` to get the patient of the appointment at the index loaded from the JSON file. The Appointment object is then instantiated.

![LoadAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/LoadAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Save Appointments after every command

**Overview**

* The app runs `LogicManager#saveAppointmentBook()`.
* `LogicManager#saveAppointmentBook()` gets the index of the patient referenced by the appointment, that is to be stored as `JSONAdaptedAppointments` in JSON file.

**Detailed Implementation**

After every command that the user makes, appointments are saved. In `LogicManager#executes`, after every command is executed, `LogicManager` calls `StorageManager#saveAppointmentBook`, passing in the appointment book and address book from `Model` as arguments. In converting model-type Appointments to `JSONAdaptedAppointment`, `AddressBook#getIndexOfPatient()` is called to get the corresponding index of the patient for storage.

The diagram below is a more in-dcannnepth look at how `JSONAdaptedAppointment` is instantiated.

**Design considerations**

**Aspect: How Appointments are loaded and saved**

| Design Choice | Justification | Pros | Cons |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Save `Appointment` as the index of corresponding patient in `AddressBook` and datetime. (current choice)** | The order of `AddressBook` does not change when saving or loading `AppointmentBook`. The order of `AddressBook` is saved each time `AppointmentBook` is saved. | <ui><li>Index of patient requires less code then implementing a unique ID and fits with our theme of using indices in commands.</li> <li>Index of patient is guaranteed to be a unique identifier.</li></ui>| Order of the `AddressBook` is important. If the order of patients is changed in the json file, the appointments will become incorrect. |
| Implement a hash or Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) to for each Patient and Appointment object. Save `Appointment` with Patient UUID and save `Patient` with Appointment UUID. | - | Changing the order of appointments and patients in saved JSON file will not change affect loading of data. | <ui><li>Requires more code to implement a unique hash or UUID and find the corresponding Patient and Appointment by traversing the `AddressBook` and `AppointmentBook` respectively.</li><li> Takes more computational work when loading compared to finding the `Patient` at an index at O(1) time.</li></ui> |


#### Delete Patient that has made an Appointment

**Overview**

Delete all `Appointments` containing that `Patient` object when `Patient` object is deleted.


**Detailed Implementation** 

The user executes `pt delete 1` to delete the first patient in the address book. The patient is deleted and the corresponding appointments and archive appointments with that patient are deleted. The `pt delete` command calls `AddressBook#deleteAppointmentsWithPatient()` to delete all appointments to that patient before deleting the patient.

**Design considerations**

**Aspect: When a patient that has appointment is deleted**

| Design Choice | Justification | Pros | Cons |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Delete all appointments that the patient has (current choice)** | `Appointments` is a class that is instantiated with a `Patient` object. When that corresponding `Patient` object is deleted, the `Patient`s appointment objects should be deleted as well so there will be no reference to deleted `Patient` objects. | <ui><li>Ensures `Patient` object is deleted completely from the system, and no objects holds references to deleted `Patient` objects.</li> <li>No `Appointment` objects will reference an invalid `Patient` object.</li></ui>| <ui><li>Accidental deleting of a `Patient` will delete all corresponding `Appointments` which may cause extra hassle to enter in all the `Appointment` details again.</li><li>No past appointment data of deleted `Patients` can be kept because their `Appointment` objects are deleted to garbage collect and truly delete `Patient` objects.</li></ui> |
| **Delete patient without deleting the patient's appointments** | - | Past appointment data of `Patient` object can be kept as archives in the system. `Patient` object is not truly deleted and can be restored if needed. | <ui><li>Requires more code to implement an indicator if `Patient` of an `Appointment` has been deleted to safeguard against Upcoming `Appointments` made for deleted `Patients`. </li><li> Deleted `Patient` object will need to be saved and loaded from JSON which would require corresponding storage classes such as `DeletedPatientBook` to be created. </li></ui> |



#### Archiving an Appointment

**Overview**

A user is able to archive an appointment when the appointment is _expired_, i.e. the patient has either missed his/her appointment
or already attended the scheduled appointment. In this case, the appointment should be archived, so that clinic staff
are able to view what medicine was prescribed to the patient during previous appointments.

**Implementation Details**

![Sequence diagram of Archive Command](diagrams/ArchiveCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


Users may archive specific appointments manually to remove visual clutter. This is done through the `ArchiveAppointmentCommand`.

The above sequence diagram displays how the archive command works. The parsing mechanism has been abstracted out from the above diagram as it
has been covered in previous diagrams. An example input can be viewed in our [User guide](UserGuide.md). It first retrieves the Appointment to archive from the
appointment index parsed through the user input, removes the appointment from upcoming appointments, and adds it to archived appointments.

Archiving is facilitated by the `ArchivedAppointmentBook`. As opposed to the regular `AppointmentBook`, it does not allow
users to directly modify the data of appointments as archived data should not be edited. Hence, the following operations
have the `private` access modifier:

- `ArchivedAppointmentBook#setAppointment(Appointment target, Appointment editedAppointment)` - edits the `target` Appointment
  to be replaced with `editedAppointment`.
- `ArchivedAppointmentBook#removeAppointment(Appointment key)` - removes the target Appointment `key`.

The reason these methods exist in the class is so to support the methods `ArchivedAppointmentBook#updatePatient(Patient target, Patient editedPatient)`
and `ArchivedAppointmentBook#removePatient(Patient target)`, which are called to accurately reflect any updates/removals of patient
details.

![Class diagram of Archive Storage](diagrams/ArchivedStorageClassDiagram.png)

In the `Storage` component, the addition of `ArchivedAppointmentBook` also necessitates the implementation of a separate storage system
for archived appointments. This forms under `ArchivedAppointmentBookStorage`, alongside `AddressBookStorage` and `AppointmentBookStorage`.
The .json file for archived appointments is named 'archivedappointmentbook.json'.

**Design Considerations**

| Alternative Considered | Current implementation | Rationale for current implementation |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Implementing archived appointments as a second `UniqueAppointmentList` attribute under the `AppointmentBook` class | Have a separate class `ArchivedAppointmentBook` | Having a separate class `ArchivedAppointmentBook` separates the two types of appointments better to facilitate data management. It ties in better with our Storage framework, and archivedappointmentbook.json files can be easily used by the user, instead of having to split one appointmentbook.json files into two segments. |


#### Auto-Archiving Feature

The archiving implementation involves scanning through all appointments in a day and comparing it to
the current date and time of the user system. If the current date and time is 24 hours ahead of the scheduled
appointment time (24-hour buffer), i.e. by our definition, _expired_, the appointment is automatically archived. This auto-archiving implementation is handled
by the `ModelManager` class in two ways.

![Sequence diagram of Auto-Archive Feature](diagrams/AutoArchiveSequenceDiagram.png)

1. Upon initialisation of the application, the application automatically archives expired appointments (24-hours past their
   scheduled time). This is called through `ModelManager#archivePastAppointments()`.


2. A `ScheduledExecutorService` object schedules the task `AutoArchiveApmts` which implements the `Runnable` interface.
   Every day at the `ModelManager.UPDATE_HOUR`th hour, the `Runnable` object executes the `ModelManager#archivePastAppointments()`
   method.


In the case where there are many scheduled appointments, this saves the user trouble of archiving past appointments when
they are already over.

### Recording a Patient's Prescription feature

During appointments, the doctor can provide prescription of drugs for patients.
Recording this information together with appointment information helps clinic staff to keep track of prescriptions given to a patient.
Past prescriptions can also be viewed with past appointments.

#### How Prescription is implemented
Prescription derives from the original Tags class from AB3 and is modified with extra fields and checks.
* Each `Prescription` class contains fields recording Medicine, Volume and Duration.
* Each `Appointment` class contains 0 or more `Prescription` objects.

![Class diagram of Prescription](diagrams/PrescriptionClassDiagram.png)

The implementation of the Prescription class is done with a ```Prescription``` class. The ```Prescription``` class keep records of the medicine given, volume of medicine, and the duration which the medicine is taken.
```Prescription``` objects are composed under ```Appointment``` objects, and will be deleted along with the parent ```Appointment``` object.
Within each ```Appointment``` class, a collection of these ```Prescription``` objects are stored.

The following commands are available from the ```Appointment``` class to interact with ```Prescription``` objects.

* ```addPrescription(Prescription prescription)```- adds a new prescription for that appointment.
* ```deletePrescription(String medicineName)```- removes an existing prescription based on the name of the medicine.

#### Reason for implementation of Prescription

```Prescription``` and ```Appointment``` forms a whole-part relationship and hence ```Prescription``` is suitable to be stored as a field of ```Appointment```.
```Prescription``` will also be deleted when appointment is deleted due to this whole-part relationship.  As an ```Appointment``` can have multiple ```Prescription``` objects, the multiplicity is many to one.


#### Prescription commands
The flow of how a command for prescription is processed is shown in the diagram below.
![Activity diagram of Prescription commands](diagrams/PrescriptionActivityDiagram.png)

##### Add Prescription command
The command structure for add prescription command follows the sequence diagram below.
![Sequence diagram diagram of Add Prescription commands](diagrams/AddPrescriptionCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Delete Prescription command sequence
The command structure for delete prescription command follows the sequence diagram below.
![Sequence diagram diagram of Delete Prescription commands](diagrams/DeletePrescriptionCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

##### General Prescription command sequence
When `execute()` is called upon the prescriptionCommand object, the prescriptionCommand object checks if the appointment to be targeted
exists by calling the getAppointmentBook() function of the model, which returns a list of available appointments. Once verified that
the appointment to be targeted exists, the respective add/delete prescription command is called in the `Model` object. The `Model` object
then checks for the validity of the prescription command by checking for existence of the same prescription in the targeted appointment.
Once the check has been done, the prescription in question is added/removed and a CommandResult is returned.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Authorised staff from small family clinics (both receptionist and doctors)
* Clinic staff from clinics that lack access to cloud and are undeveloped compared to hospitals
* Clinic staff from young clinics that do not have technological capabilities
* Prefer a type-first experience, and can type fast

**Value proposition**:
* Provide a centralised platform for clinic staff to manage patient records, reducing man hours from managing paper documents

Today, small family clinics often record patient information using paper application forms.
Such recording of patient information results in the clinic having a messy and inefficient patient record information;
the family clinic will have to flip through files and documents in order to find the patient. Doc’it aims to provide a
centralised platform for authorised staff from small family clinics to view, update and onboard patients.
With Doc’it, small family clinics are able to reduce man hours from managing paper documents,
and translate these ‘saved’ hours into providing better frontline service to patients, focusing on what they do best.
