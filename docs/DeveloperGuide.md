### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

-   At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
-   At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

-   [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
-   [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
-   [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
-   [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletecontact 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

-   defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
-   implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/MainApp.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

-   executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
-   listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
-   depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` and `Policy` object residing in the `Model`.
-   keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
-   is referenced by the `Logic` component, because the `Warning` class in `Logic` relies on `MainWindow` for the user input in the dialog box.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800" />

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SiasaParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPolicyCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `SiasaParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPolicyCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPolicyCommand`) which the `SiasaParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPolicyCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletepolicy 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletepolicy 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePolicyCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/model/Model.java)

![Model Component Class Diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

- stores the SIASA data i.e., all `Contact` and `Policy` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` and
  `UniquePolicyList `object respectively).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` and `Policy` objects (e.g., results of a search query) in a separate filtered_list each
  which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` that can be 'observed'
  e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components
  (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-4/tp/blob/2d1b8809aa8b78086507f8e2a5d48bc05a385e01/src/main/java/seedu/siasa/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

-   can save both SIASA data (contacts and policies) and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
-   inherits from both `SiasaStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
-   depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.siasa.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Creating Policies

This section explains the process of adding a `Policy` to the `Policy` list that belongs to an owner which is a `Contact`.
This is similar to how a `Contact` is created as well with some highlighted differences elaborated below.

The `AddPolicyCommand` will create a new `Policy` with the specified details and add it to the application. This command requires
the `Policy`'s details and the `Contact`'s `Index` to specify which `Contact` the policy belongs to.

The `AddPolicyCommand#execute` method obtains the `Contact` object, the owner,
from the `Model` using the `Index` and creates the policy with the details and the owner. Then it updates the `Model`'s `UniquePolicyList`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `AddPolicyCommand` is executed.
![](images/AddPolicyParserSequenceDiagram.png)

**Step 1.** The user enters the command `addpolicy n/critical illness p/30000 4 120 c/10 30 cl/2`

**Step 2.** User input is passed to `SiasaParser` which creates a `AddPolicyCommandParser` object and calls `AddPolicyCommandParser#parse` with the arguments.
This creates a new `AddPolicyCommand` by passing in the `Policy`'s details and owner `Contact`'s `Index`.

![](images/AddPolicyCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)

**Step 3.** The `AddPolicyCommand` is executed by `LogicManager` by calling the `execute` method.

**Step 4.** As the model is passed into the `execute` method, the list of `Contact`s save in the model can be obtained
by calling `Model#getFilteredContactList`. The owner `Contact` is obtained from the list using the `Index`.

**Step 5.** The policy to be added is created by passing in the details and the owner `Contact`.

**Step 6.** The policy is added to the model by calling `Model#addPolicy`.

#### Notable differences with creating contact
1. The Contact to be added is created within `AddContactCommandParser#parse` and not in `AddContactCommand#execute`.
2. No Contact details are passed into `AddContactCommand`


#### Design considerations:
#### How to create the `Policy` to be added.
* **Alternative 1 (chosen)**: `Policy` details and Contact Index are passed into `AddPolicyCommand`, when executed, owner
  `Contact` is obtained from the `Model` and `Policy` to be added is created.
    * Advantage over alt. 2:
        * Less coupling since the parser does not need a reference to `Model`.
        * Cleaner implementation of `SiasaParser#parse` since all `CommandParser`s do not need a reference to `Model`.
* **Alternative 2**: `Model` reference is passed into `AddPolicyCommandParser#parse`. `Contact` is obtained from the `Model`
  and the `Policy` to be added is created within parse. The created `Policy` is then passed into the `AddPolicyCommand` constructor.
    * Advantage over alt. 1:
        * Greater abstraction since `Policy` components are not revealed and stored within the `AddPolicyCommand`
        * Consistent with the implementation of `AddContactCommand`.

### Editing Contact
`EditContactCommand` requires an `EditContactDescriptor` which encapsulates the intended changes to the `Contact` and
the `Index` of the `Contact` to be edited.

Due to the immutable nature of both `Contact` and `Policy`, editing a `Contact`'s details would require creating a new `Contact`
object. In addition, as `Policy` has an owner field, all `Policies` that belong to the edited `Contact` need to be edited and a
new `Policy` object would need to be created for each of them with the edited new `Contact` object as the owner.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `EditContactCommand` is executed.
![](images/EditContactCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

**Step 1**: `EditContactCommand#execute` is called which gets the `contactToEdit` from the `Model` using the `Index` provided,
similar to the process in `AddPolicyCommand`.

**Step 2**: Using the `EditContactDescriptor` object and the `contactToEdit`, a new `editedContact` is created by calling
`EditContactCommand#createEditedContact`.

**Step 3**: Policies belonging to the `contactToEdit` is obtained from the `Model`.

**Step 4**: For each of the policies, a new `Policy` object is created with identical fields but with `editedContact` as the owner and
the `Model` is updated with these new policies.

**Step 5** The `contactToEdit` is replaced by the `editedContact` by calling `Model#setContact`.
#### Design considerations:
#### Immutability of Contact and Policy
* **Alternative 1 (chosen)**: Both `Contact` and `Policy` are immutable. Therefore, any edit to `Policy` or `Contact` requires new objects
  to be created.
    * Advantage over 2:
        * With the invariant that an object will not be changed once created, it is easier to design,
          implement and use the application as code complexity increases.
        * Thread safety
* **Alternative 2**: Both `Contact` and `Policy` are mutable. Any changes to `Policy` or `Contact` can be done simply by modifying the fields.
    * Advantage over 1:
        * Less objects need to be created, arguably better performance as number of entries increase.
* **Reason for choice**: Despite performance concerns, application meets performance requirements from testing.

### Sorting and Filtering

This section explains the implementation of the Sorting and Filtering feature. They are both implemented with a similar concept.

The set of sorting commands are `sortcontact` and `sortpolicy`, while the set of filtering commands are `findcontact`, `contactpolicy` and `expiringpolicy`.

#### Design Considerations

1. The sorting/filtering method has to be generic so that we can implement multiple different sorters/filters without significant code duplication.
2. The sorting functionality has to work alongside the preexisting filtering functionality.
3. The sorting and filtering functionality has to be *stackable*; Lists should allow filtering then sorting and vice-versa.

#### Implementation

Initially, the `ObservableList` provided by the `ModelManager` returns a `FilteredList`. The `FilteredList` took in a `Predicate` that would be applied on the list.

To implement the sorting functionality, we wrapped the `FilteredList` around a `SortedList`. The `SortedList` takes in a `Comparator` that would be applied on the list.

In the constructor of `ModelManager`, the list provided by `ObservableList`s of Contacts and Policies are first passed into the constructor of the `SortedList` then the `FilteredList`.

Due to the implementation of both `SortedList` and `FilteredList`, if the underlying content of the lists were to change, so would theirs.

The respective parsers would construct the commands with the correct `Predicate`s or `Comparator`s depending on the arguments provided by the user. Then, the commands, when executed, will apply them to the respective lists in the model.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

![Sequence diagram when the user executes `sortpolcy dsc`](images/SortPolicyDscSequenceDiagram.png)

**Step 1.** The user executes the command `sortpolicy titledsc`.

**Step 2.** User input is passed to the `SiasaParser` and `SiasaParser` will call `SortPolicyCommandParser#parse`, which creates a new `SortPolicyCommand` with the `SORT_POLICY_BY_TITLE_DSC` Comparator.

**Step 3.** The `SortPolicyCommand` will then be executed by calling its `execute` method.

**Step 4.** Since the `Model` is passed to `SortPolicyCommand#execute`, it is able to call a method `Model#updateFilteredPolicyList` to update the Comparator for the Policy `FilteredList`.

**Step 5.** After the Comparator is applied, the Policy List view on the UI will automatically display the list with the correct sorting order.

#### Special Notes

- `contactpolicy` applies a `PolicyIsOwnedBy` predicate that takes in a `Contact`. It will return `true` if the `owner` field of the `Policy` is equals to the `Contact` taken in.
- `expiringpolicy` applies a predicate that returns true if the `ExpiryDate` of a `Policy` is within the next month.

### Download Command

This section explains the mechanism behind ```DownloadCommand``` used to download CSV files containing useful statistics. These include:
- commission earned per contact
- number of policies per contact,

The command requires no parameters. ```DownloadCommand``` implements ```DownloadCommand#execute```, that calls
the relevant methods in ```Model``` to obtain the various statistics. The methods ```DownloadCommand#commissionStringListBuilder```
and ```DownloadCommand#noPoliciesStringListBuilder``` are then invoked, to convert the statistics information as a list of strings. The list of strings is then written to
the file via ```DownloadCommand#writeToCsv```.

This is the sequence diagram of the interactions between ```Logic``` and ```Model``` component for the command.

![DownloadSequenceDiagram](images/DownloadSequenceDiagram.png)

### Warning

This section explains the use of ```Warning```, a class which encapsulates a warning that a ```Command``` can give. Specifically,
it displays a warning dialog to the user, and returns the user's decision to proceed as a boolean value. The ```Command``` triggering
the ```Warning```  can then decide what to do with the user's decision.

```Warning``` has a static method ```Warning#isUserConfirmingCommand``` that requires a description of the warning as a
String, and returns the decision of the user's decision. When ```Warning#isUserConfirmingCommand``` is invoked, it calls
```MainWindow#showWarning```, that will create a new ```WarningWindow``` to display. ```WarningWindow``` has the
command ```WarningWindow#isUserConfirmingCommand``` that will return the user's decision.

This is the sequence diagram of how a ```Command ``` might call a ```Warning```, and the interactions between the ```Logic```
and ```UI``` components.

![WarningSequenceDiagram](images/WarningSequenceDiagram.png)

The activity diagram below summarizes how a ```Warning``` should be used within execution of a ```Command```.

![WarningActivityDiagram](images/WarningActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

Typically, displaying the UI involves executing the command text in ```MainWindow#executeCommand``` and then interpreting the
```CommandResult``` to decide what UI changes to make.

However for the implementation of ```Warning```, the user input in ```UI``` component has to be sent back to the ```Logic```
component, so that the ```Command``` can decide whether to execute or abort. Displaying ```Warning``` in ```MainWindow#executeCommand```
will then be too late.

##### Aspect: How to obtain User Response from a UI WarningWindow Component

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** create a static method ```MainWindow#showWarning``` to handle ```WarningWindow```
operations.
- Pros:
    - Maintains the UI structure of ```MainWindow``` controlling all the smaller UI parts.
- Cons:
    - A more complex implementation to control ```WarningWindow```
**Alternative 2:** Have the ```Command``` call a method in ```WarningWindow``` directly.
- Pros:
    - A more straightforward implementation.
- Cons:
    - Violates the structure of ```MainWindow``` being the controller of other UI parts.


Therefore, we decided on a static ```MainWindow#showWarning``` to allow for a return value that can be used by methods
in ```Logic``` component. While it may have been simpler for ```Logic``` to interact directly with ```WarningWindow```,
it breaks the structure of ```MainWindow``` being the main UI components to manage smaller components.

## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Our target audience is a student who,
-   is working as a financial advisor
-   has a need to quickly and easily keep track of their:
    1. contacts
    2. financial policies sold

-   prefer desktop apps over other types
-   can type fast
-   prefers typing to mouse interactions
-   is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Currently, there are no good contact applications on desktop that allow student financial advisors, that do not have time to use complex contact book applications, to easily keep track of their contacts and policies.

Siasa enables student financial advisors to quickly and easily keep track of their contacts (both potential clients and existing clients) and financial plans sold to aid their operations. The different payment structures also provide better customisation for student financial advisors, allowing them to better record any policies they may have sold.

Siasa also provides valuable data and statistics in `.csv` files for a quick summary and analysis of all the current policies, allowing such students to get the necessary information and data in a fast and efficient manner.
