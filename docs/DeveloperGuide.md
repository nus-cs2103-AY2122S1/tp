### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete module m/CS2103`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Module` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When the `Logic` is called upon to execute `delete module m/CS2103`, it uses the `TeachingAssistantBuddyParser` class to parse the user command.
2. The `TeachingAssistantBuddyParser` parses the first command word `delete`, and pass the rest of the input to a `DeleteCommandParser`.
3. The `DeleteCommandParser` then figures out the type of object to delete, in this case a `Module` object as indicated by `module`.
4. The `DeleteModuleCommandParser` will wrap the module name in a `ModuleName` object and pass it into a `DeleteModuleCommand`.
5. This results in a `DeleteModuleCommand` object (which is a subclass of `DeleteCommand`), which is executed by the `Logic Manager`.

![How the command `delete module m/CS2103` is parsed in the Logic component](images/DeleteModuleSequenceDiagram1.png)
6. The `DeleteModuleCommand` communicates with the `Model` when it is executed.
7. The `Model` will look for a `Module` with the specified `ModuleName` and delete it.
8. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

![How the `DeleteModuleCommand` is executed](images/DeleteModuleSequenceDiagram2.png)

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TeachingAssistantBuddyParser` class creates an `XYZTypeCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `Add`, `Edit`. `Type` is a placeholer for the type of object to be operated on e.g., `Module`, `Student` or `Task`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZTypeCommand` object (e.g., `AddModuleCommand`) which the `TeachingAssistantBuddyParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZTypeCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddModuleCommandParser`, `DeleteModuleCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the Teaching Assistant Buddy data i.e., all `Module` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueModuleList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Module` objects which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. `Module` also stores a unique student list and a filtered student list (used for example, when searching for a specific `Student`). Each `Student` has a unique task list.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both teaching assistant buddy data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TeachingAssistantBuddy` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Module

## **Appendix: Effort**

With AB3 as the baseline of comparison, our project is much more demanding. 
AB3, as an address book application that manages contact details, has only one model which is a Person. 
For our project which is building a helper for teaching assistants, there are three models, namely, Modules, Students, and Tasks.

This created some problems when we were designing the UI, including how to arrange these three types of objects, and what their relationship would be. 
A meeting was held, during which we used Miro to come up with wireframes and prototypes and conducted discussions to finalise our design. 
Although it was harder to manage more than one type of object, we all embraced this challenge and successfully rendered a working product.

Another challenge we faced was more specific. When we added in students and tasks to TAB, tasks under some students were not shown.
And this bug was inconsistent - sometimes we could not reproduce it even when following the exact steps.
We initially considered it as a UI bug and wasn't sure how to go about solving it. But we did not give up and leave it unattended.
After much effort, one of us discovered that these missing tasks were not added to their corresponding students in time.
Following this lead, another team member located to code that was causing this issue and fixed it.
With hard work and perseverance, we managed to solve something previously thought of as unsolvable.

Other challenges we had included dealing with testing and storage. For many of us, this was the first time handling these aspects of coding.
It was not easy, especially for those members who volunteered as trailblazers and set the standard for writing test cases and storage-related logic. 
Kudos to them!

Overall, this project posed many difficulties and challenges that we had to overcome.
To many of us, this was the first collaborative software engineering project that involved facets that were once unfamiliar, such as testing, UI and storage.
It would be an understatement to say that it was not easy.
Nevertheless, we, together as a team, rose above all these obstacles and passed this trial of diligence, determination, resourcefulness, and teamwork.
