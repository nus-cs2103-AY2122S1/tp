Welcome to the CSBook Developer Guide. CSBook is a **desktop app for teaching assistants (TAs) to manage their students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This guide is designed for developers that are interested to work
on this app. It contains detailed information that will allow developers to maintain the app or
alter and extend the app for their own use.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of Ui Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts: `CommandBox`, `ResultPopup`, `StudentListPanel`, `GroupListPanel`, `DetailedStudentCard`, `AssessmentListPanel` and `StatusBarFooter`.

The `StudentListPanel` consists of a list of `StudentCard` objects, which displays the student's name and group they belong to.

The `GroupListPanel` consists of a list of `GroupCard` objects, which displays the group's name and description.

The `AssessmentListPanel` consists of a list of `AssessmentCard` objects, which displays the assessment's name, score and percentage.

The `DetailedStudentCard` displays the student's name, group, telegram handle, email and notes.

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student`,`Group`, `Assessment` and `Note` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CsBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `CsBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CsBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the CS book data i.e., all `Student` and `Group` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` and `UniqueGroupList` object respectively).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores the currently 'selected' `Group` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list similarly to `Student` objects with an `ObservableList<Group>`.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** How `Group` and `Student` objects are stored and referenced by each other is shown in the diagram below. In the future, the model will be changed such that each `Student` will only have a `GroupName` to identify the `Group` it is associated with, and each `Group` will only store the `Name` of the `Student` in the `Group`. This will be done in hopes of looser coupling between the two classes.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both CS book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `CsBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.csbook.commons` package.

---

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Loading data

The loading of data into CsBook is facilitated by `JsonCsBookStorage`, `JsonSerializableCsBook`, `JsonAdaptedGroup` and
`JsonAdaptedStudent`. The relevant operations for loading CSBook data is as follows:

- `JsonCsBookStorage#readCsBook()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Reads the current CSBook data
- `JsonSerializableCsBook#toModelType()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Converts the JsonSerializableCsBook to a CsBook object
- `JsonSerializableCsBook#addStudentsToCsBook(csBook)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Adds all students to a given CsBook
- `JsonSerializableCsBook#addGroupsToCsBook(csBook)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Adds all groups to a given CsBook
- `JsonSerializableCsBook#addStudentsToGroups(csBook)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Adds all students to their corresponding Groups
- `JsonAdaptedStudent#toModelType(groupList)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Converts the JsonAdaptedStudent to a Student object
- `JsonAdaptedGroup#toModelType()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Converts the JsonAdaptedGroup to a Group object

Given below how loading data behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user starts the app and an encrypted data file containing CsBook's information is present. The data
is decrypted and a call to `JsonCsBookStorage#readCsBook()` is made. After this, a call to `JsonSerializableCsBook#toModelType()`
is made to convert the data into a CsBook object.

![LoadSequence0](images/LoadSequence0.png)

\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 2**. First, we add the groups from the data into CsBook by calling `JsonSerializableCsBook#addGroupsToCsBook(csBook)`.
Next, we add the students from the data into Csbook by calling `JsonAdaptedStudent#toModelType(groupList)`. `groupList` is
required to add students to ensure that each student has a valid group.

![LoadSequence1](images/LoadSequence1.png)

\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 3**. Currently, each group does not have its lists of students, we would need to add it in using `JsonSerializableCsBook#addStudentsToGroups(csBook)`.
The group list is retrieved from `csBook`. For each group in the group list, we will filter the list of students by checking if the student belongs to the group,
then add the students in by calling `Group#addAll(StudentsInGroup)`. This would return us a new group that contains the students, and we will update `csBook` by calling
`CsBook#setGroup(group, groupWithStudentList)`.

![LoadSequence2](images/LoadSequence2.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

The following sequence diagram shows how the overall loading data operation works:

![LoadSequenceAll](images/LoadSequenceAll.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How we choose to load data:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Load groups without their student list, load students, then update each group's student list using the loaded students.

  - Pros: Allows us to validate the student's group name field and saves space as we do not need to store the student list for each group in our data file.
  - Cons: May take more time to load as we need to do more computation.

- **Alternative 2:** Have each group store their student's information in the data file, load students and load groups separately.

  - Pros: Less computation as we can immediately convert the data file to retrieve the students and groups.
  - Cons: Wastes space as each student's details is recorded twice in the data file, once in the list of students and
    once in the list of groups.

### JSON encryption feature

The JSON encryption mechanism is facilitated by `JsonCsBookStorage`, `EncryptedJsonUtil`, `EncryptionUtil` and `FileUtil`.
Java's `SealedObject` class is also used to encrypt and contain a `Serializable` object. The relevant operations for saving the
CSBook data to an encrypted JSON file are as follows:

- `JsonCsBookStorage#saveCsBook(ReadOnlyCsBook)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Saves the current CSBook data
- `EncryptedJsonUtil#saveEncryptedJsonFile(T, Path)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Saves the given data to a encrypted JSON file
- `EncryptionUtil.encryptSerializableObject(Serializable)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Encrypts a `Serializable` object
- `FileUtil#writeToEncryptedFile(Path, SealedObject)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Writes the encrypted object to a file

Decrypting an encrypted JSON file goes through a similar process. The relevant operations for decrypting the
encrypted JSON file to the CSBook are as follows:

- `JsonCsBookStorage#readCsBook()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Reads the CSBook data from the encrypted JSON file
- `EncryptedJsonUtil#readEncryptedJsonFile(Path, Class<T>)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Reads the data from a encrypted JSON file
- `EncryptionUtil#decryptSealedObject(SealedObject)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Decrypts a `SealedObject`
- `FileUtil#readFromEncryptedFile(Path)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Reads the encrypted object from a file

Given below is an example usage scenario and how encryption/decryption behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user executes a command which causes the data in `csbook` of `ModelManager` to be altered. This prompts a call to
`JsonCsBookStorage#saveCsBook(ReadOnlyCsBook)`, which creates a new `JsonSerializableCsBook` object. The CSBook data which is
now in `Serializable` form is passed to `EncryptedJsonUtil#saveEncryptedJsonFile(T, Path)` to be saved as an encrypted JSON file.

![EncryptSequence0](images/EncryptSequence0.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 2**. `EncryptedJsonUtil#saveEncryptedJsonFile(T, Path)` uses the `JsonSerializableCsBook` object, which is a `Serializable`,
and encrypts it using `EncryptionUtil.encryptSerializableObject(Serializable)`. The method returns a `SealedObject` object,
which contains the encrypted JSON data.

![EncryptSequence1](images/EncryptSequence1.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 3**. Now that the CSBook JSON data has been encrypted, the final step is to write the encrypted data to a file.
`EncryptedJsonUtil` passes the `SealedObject` object to `FileUtil#writeToEncryptedFile(Path, SealedObject)` to be written to a file.

![EncryptSequence2](images/EncryptSequence2.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

The following sequence diagram shows how the overall encryption operation works:

![EncryptSequenceAll](images/EncryptSequenceAll.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

The decryption operation accomplishes the opposite of the encryption operation.

**Step 4**. When a user launches the application for the first time, a call it made to `JsonCsBookStorage#readCsBook()`
to read the encrypted CSBook data, which then calls `EncryptedJsonUtil#readEncryptedJsonFile(Path, Class<T>)` to
read the encrypted JSON file.

![DecryptSequence0](images/DecryptSequence0.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 5**. `EncryptedJsonUtil#readEncryptedJsonFile(Path, Class<T>)` calls `FileUtil#readFromEncryptedFile(Path)` to
read the encrypted JSON file from the `filePath`. The method results in a `SealedObject` object containing the
encrypted CSBook data.

![DecryptSequence1](images/DecryptSequence1.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 6**. The `SealedObject` object is then passed to `EncryptionUtil#decryptSealedObject(SealedObject)` to be decrypted into a `Serializable`
object, which is then converted to a JSON file using `EncryptedJsonUtil#fromJsonString(String, Class<T>)`. The resulting file is then
transformed by `JsonCsBookStorage#readCsBook()` into a `ReadOnlyCsBook` that is used to populate the model.

![DecryptSequence2](images/DecryptSequence2.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

The following sequence diagram shows how the overall decryption operation works:

![DecryptSequenceAll](images/DecryptSequenceAll.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How JSON encryption and decryption executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encrypts the entire CSBook data.

  - Pros: More secure.
  - Cons: May take up more storage due to excessive encryption.

- **Alternative 2:** Encrypts individual fields.

  - Pros: Uses less storage by encrypting data and not fields.
    (e.g. `name: Jun Wei` is encrypted to become `name: [ENCRYPTED]`)
  - Cons: Less secure compared to encrypting the entire JSON file.

### Student Group Management Feature

The management of `Group` objects and `Student` objects is done by the `ModelManager`.
While the choosing of operations to perform is determined by the user through the use of commands
(E.g. `AddCommand`), we mainly discuss how `Group` objects reference `Student` objects and vice versa
through discussing the implementation of the `ModelManager` class and `Student`, `Group` object fields.

The relevant operations for managing groups, with regard to `Student` operations are as follows:

- `ModelManager#deleteStudent(Student)` - Deletes a `Student` from the model, and remove the `Student` reference from
  the respective `Group` that the student belongs to
- `ModelManager#addStudent(Student)` - Adds a `Student` to the model, and add a reference to the `Student` in the
  respective `Group` the student is assigned to

The relevant operations for managing groups, with regard to `Group` operations are as follows:

- `ModelManager#deleteGroup(Group)` - Deletes a `Group` from the model, as well as delete all `Student` objects
  associated with the group
- `ModelManager#addGroup(Group)` - Adds a `Group` to the model

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the management of groups behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. Starting with an empty model, the user will first have to create an empty `Group` to be able to add `Student`
objects to. The user executes a command that will create a new `Group` and add it to the model by calling
`ModelManager#addGroup(Group)`.

![GroupManagementSequence0](images/GroupManagementSequence0.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 2**. After the `Group` is added to the model, the user then executes a command to create a new `Student` that will
be a part of an existing group. This command will then call `ModelManager#addStudent(Student)` with the created
`Student` which finds the `Group` that the `Student` is to be added to, include a reference to the `Student` in the `Group`,
then finally add the `Student` into the `CsBook` model.

![GroupManagementSequence1](images/GroupManagementSequence1.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

(Optional steps) The user may manipulate the groups or individual students using any of the available commands, but
these will not be discussed here as the focus is on how the grouping of students is done.

**Step 3**. The user executes a command to delete a `Student` in order to, for example, remove a past student. The command
then invokes `ModelManager#deleteStudent(Student)`, which will find the respective `Group` that the `Student` belongs to
using the stored `GroupName` reference in the `Student` and remove the `Group`'s reference to the `Student` (`StudentName`).
Then, the `Student` itself is deleted from the model.

![GroupManagementSequence2](images/GroupManagementSequence2.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 4**. The user executes a command to delete a `Group` in order to, for example, remove an entire group and its
students after the user has finished teaching a module. The command invokes `ModelManager#deleteGroup(Group)`, which
finds the `Group` in the model, and for each `Name` found, remove the associated `Student` from `csbook`.
After all `Student` objects associated with the `Group` has been removed, the `Group` itself is then deleted.

![GroupManagementSequence3](images/GroupManagementSequence3.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How a Student references a Group and vice versa:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each `Group` only stores unique student `Name`s and `Student` stores unique `GroupName`s

  - Pros: Reduces coupling between `Group` and `Student` significantly
  - Cons: We must ensure that both `Name` and `GroupName`s are all unique throughout the `csbook`

- **Alternative 2 (old implementation):** Each `Group` stores a reference of `Student` and vice versa

  - Pros: More straightforward to implement.
  - Cons: Increases coupling between `Group` and `Student` significantly

**Aspect: What happens when `ModelManager#deleteGroup(Group)` command is executed:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes all `Student` objects associated with the `Group`

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: Restricts us to just one `Group` per `Student` when implemented as-is

- **Alternative 2:** Only delete the `Group` itself and only remove the `Group` reference within `Student` objects

  - Pros: Allows for a `Student` to belong to multiple `Group`s
  - Cons: When implemented as-is, allows `Student`s to not belong to any `Group`, violating our assumption that all
    `Student`s have a `Group`

---

## **Proposed Implementation**

This section describes implementation details of new features that can be included in future versions of this application.

### Undo/redo feature

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCsBook`. It extends `CsBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `csBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedCsBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current CS book state in its history.
- `VersionedCsBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous CS book state from its history.
- `VersionedCsBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone CS book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCsBook()`, `Model#undoCsBook()` and `Model#redoCsBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCsBook` will be initialized with the initial CS book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single CS book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 2**. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the CS book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCsBook()`, causing the modified state of the CS book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `csBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted CS book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 3**. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCsBook()`, causing another modified CS book state to be saved into the `csBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCsBook()`, so the CS book state will not be saved into the `csBookStateList`.

</div>

**Step 4**. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCsBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous CS book state, and restores the CS book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial CsBook state, then there are no previous CsBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCsBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoCsBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the CS book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `csBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CS book state, then there are no undone CsBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCsBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

**Step 5**. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the CS book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCsBook()`, `Model#undoCsBook()` or `Model#redoCsBook()`. Thus, the `csBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

**Step 6**. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCsBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `csBookStateList`, all CS book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CS book.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  (Compatibility) Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  (Capacity/Scalability) Should be able to hold up to 100 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  (Usability) A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  (Recoverability) Should the stored student data of the application be corrupted, it can still recover and function on a clean slate by itself.
5.  (Security) The stored student data of the application should be encrpyted/stored securely to reduce the chances of an unintended leak of information from the application.

### Glossary

- **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
- **Student**: A student that is studying any specific module in university
- **Group**: A group of students that the user chooses to group together
- **Module**: An academic unit usually comprising lectures, tutorials and sometimes laboratory sessions. Teaching assistants may assist in teaching tutorial classes to a group of students
- **Teaching Assistant (TA)**: The intended user of the application, in charge of teaching at least 1 module
