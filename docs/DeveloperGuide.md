### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `ModuleLessonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `ModuleLesson` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ConthacksParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePersonCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ConthacksParser` class uses `CommandWord` to find out which `Command` the user wants. `ConthacksParser` then creates the required `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `ConthacksParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores contHACKS data i.e., all `Person` and `ModuleLesson` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueModuleLessonList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` and `ModuleLesson` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<ModuleLesson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to those lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both contHACKS data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ConthacksStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature (With `ModuleCode`)
The add feature allows user to add a `Person` or `ModuleLesson` into contHACKS. Both `Person` and `ModuleLesson` contains the member `ModuleCode`. This section elaborates on the implementation of `ModuleCode` and how it affects the add feature. 

#### About ModuleCode
`ModuleCode` is one of the parameters that must be included when adding a `Person` or `ModuleLesson`. `ModuleCode` contains the following members:
```Java
public final String value;
public final Set<LessonCode> lessonCodes;
```
The `value` refers to the module code of a NUS module `e.g. "CS2100"`.
`LessonCode` also has a `value` that refers to the code of the lesson: tutorials, labs, sectionals, etc `e.g. "T12"`
`ModuleCode` has a set of `LessonCode` because a module in NUS can indeed have many lessons.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
There is a need to associate `LessonCode` with `ModuleCode` as we need to be able to identify which `ModuleCode` a `LessonCode` belongs to.
</div>

#### Implementation
There are some distinctions between a `Person` and `ModuleLesson`. A `Person` can have many `ModuleCode`, with each `ModuleCode` having multiple `LessonCode` while a `ModuleLesson` lesson can only have one `ModuleCode`, with that `ModuleCode` having one `LessonCode`.

##### Implementation for adding `Person`
Since a `Person` can have many `ModuleCode`, an input like: `add ... m/CS2100 T19 B04 m/CS2103T T09` is valid. The following sequence diagram shows how parsing the input `add ... m/CS2100 T19 B04 m/CS2103T T09` works successfully to return a `AddPersonCommand`:

![Sequence diagram for parsing Person](images/ParseAddPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

Notice that the `AddPersonCommandParser` uses the method `parseModuleCodes()` to get a collection of `ModuleCode`.

##### Implementation for adding `ModuleLesson`
Since a `ModuleLesson` can only have one `ModuleCode` and one `LessonCode`, we need a way to enforce `lessonCodes.size() == 1` in `ModuleCode`. To achieve this, we only take the first `LessonCode` as the desired one. For example, the input `addc ... m/CS2100 T19 B09` would take `T19` as the `LessonCode` and ignore `B09`. On a similar note, to enforce having only one `ModuleCode`, we only consider the last occurrence of the parameter `m/`. For example, the input `addc ... m/CS2103T B04 m/CS2100 T19` would only consider `m/CS2100 T19` and ignore `m/CS2103T B04`. The following sequence diagram shows how parsing the input `addc ... m/CS2103T B04 m/CS2100 T19 B09` works successfully to return a `AddModuleLessonCommand` despite the extra `ModuleCode` and `LessonCode`:

![Sequence diagram for parsing ModuleLesson](images/ParseAddModuleLessonSequenceDiagram.png)

Notice that the `AddModuleLessonCommandParser` uses the method `parseModuleCodeForModuleLesson()` instead of `parseModuleCodes()` used by `AddPersonCommandParser`. This is where the distinction lies between adding `Person` and `ModuleLesson` with `ModuleCode`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: What should be associated with the `ModuleCode`:**

* **Alternative 1 (initial idea):** Have both `ModuleCode` and `LessonCode` be standalone classes associate with `Person` and `ModuleLesson`.
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Pros: Reduced coupling.
    * Cons: Unable to tell which `ModuleCode` a `LessonCode` belongs to when there are more than one `ModuleCode` and `LessonCode`. Have to find another way to make the association which would introduce dependencies and remove the pros of reduced coupling.

* **Alternative 2 (current version):** Have `ModuleCode` be associated with a set of `LessonCode`
    * Pros: Able to tell which `ModuleCode` a `LessonCode` belongs to
    * Pros: Some level of code reuse
    * Cons: Have to introduce checks to ensure `ModuleCode` only has one `LessonCode` when it is a member of `ModuleLesson`

* **Alternative 3:** Implement `ModuleCodeForPerson` and `ModuleCodeForModuleLesson`
    * Pros: No checks are required as `ModuleCodeForModuleLesson` can be implemented to only have one `LessonCode`
    * Cons: Low level of code reuse
    * Cons: Not extensible

The above information is also applicable for the edit feature.
</div>

### Find feature 
Users are able to execute a command to find an existing person in contHACKS. 
contHACKS will parse the find command for keywords, and filters the list of contacts to be displayed. 
Upon a successful search, the person card will be returned and listed in the GUI. 

![Interactions for  `find n/Alex` Command](images/FindPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

### Implementation
The find command returns contacts that matches the input keywords. Initially, it only returns contacts that fully matches the keywords.
Given the following example contact book:
* Contact #1: Jason
* Contact #2: Jasmine
* Contact #3: Bob

A search with the command `find n/Jas` would return nothing, as `Jas` is not a complete match with any of the names of the three contacts.

To better fit our target user, someone who wishes to work fast, we have decided to allow partial matches for the find command.
This is done by altering the condition in the search predicate, from accepting full word matches to accepting even partial word matches:

`return Arrays.stream(wordsInPreppedSentence).anyMatch(preppedWord::equalsIgnoreCase);`

changed to

`return Arrays.stream(wordsInPreppedSentence).anyMatch(x -> x.toLowerCase().contains(preppedWord.toLowerCase()));`

Also, to facilitate filtered searches, we have implemented finding using prefixes:
* `find n/` to find by name
* `find m/` to find by module code

Similar to other commands, this is done using a `argumentTokenizer` to parse for the above prefixes,
before the correct `Predicate` is instantiated and used for finding the contact.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Previous and current version of find command:**

* **Alternative 1 (previous version):** Search keyword needs to match entirely.
    * Pros: Only the correct contact is returned.
    * Cons: Takes time to type entire names to find the contact you want.

* **Alternative 2 (current version):** Search keyword just needs to match partially.
    * Pros: Faster searches with just partial keywords.
    * Cons: Contacts you did not mean to retrieve are also displayed.

### Delete contact by batch feature

Users are able to execute a command to delete an existing module code in contHACKS. Upon successful deletion of the module code,
the module code will not exist in contHACKS thus all lesson codes, if any, under the module code will be deleted (module and lesson have a composition relationship).
The particular contact will only be deleted from contHACKS if it is not attached to any other module code.

<img src="images/CompositionPersonAndModule.png" width="350" />

An input to delete by `delete m/CS2103T` would delete all contacts that are tagged to CS2103T. If a contact has another module code, it will only delete the module code CS2103T tag.
This is to better fit our target audience as once a class is no longer relevant, enabling a batch delete is quick and helps to keep contHACKS organised.

#### Implementation

`DeletePersonCommand` implements the `execute()` method from the `Command` abstract class whereby upon execution, the method will delete the respective contacts in the modelâ€™s list of contacts if a valid module code is provided.

This is how the `DeletePersonCommand#execute()` method works upon execution:

1. The module code to be deleted is retrieved from the `DeletePersonCommand` created.
2. All contacts with the module code will be retrieved from the model by `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.
3. The module code is deleted by `DeletePersonCommand#deleteByModuleCode()`.
4. `DeletePersonCommand#deleteByModuleCode()` will call `Model#deletePerson` for contacts with attached to the module code to delete only otherwise `DeletePersonCommand#deleteModuleCodeTag` will be called.
5. The deletion is successful and a CommandResult is returned with an appropriate success message to indicate that the deletion was successful via the CommandUtil#getCommandResult() method.

The following sequence diagrams show how the delete by module code feature works successfully, using the example command `delete m/CS2103T`:

![Interactions for  `delete m/CS2103T` Command](images/BatchDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePersonCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Previous and current version of delete command:**

* **Alternative 1 (previous version):** Delete only supports one deletion at a time.
    * Pros: Deletes the particular intended contact.
    * Cons: Takes time to delete multiple contacts, does not fit our target audience that wants operations to be fast.

* **Alternative 2 (current version):** Delete supports batch deletion by module code as well.
    * Pros: Faster deletion while still supporting deletion by one index.
    * Cons: Not able to undo the deletion if the user deletes the wrong batch, it would take a long time to key all the information back in.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:**
The above information is also applicable for the delete lesson by batch feature.
</div>

### Aliases for different commands

Aliases are alternative words that you can use to perform the same command. There are a few default aliases provided for every command.
Users can choose to use their most preferred alias to perform the command they want.

#### Implementation

How the alias work is as such:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it calls the `ConthacksParser` class to parse the user command.
2. As `ConthacksParser` parses the user command, `ConthacksParser` separates the `commandWord` string from the rest of the arguments inside the user command string.
3. `ConthacksParser` will pass this `commandWord` string into `CommandWord` enum class which contains all the aliases for the different commands. Then, `CommandWord` will check if the `commandWord` string is an alias for any of our implemented commands.
4. If the alias is a legitimate alias for any of the `XYZCommand`, `CommandWord` class will return the respective `CommandWord` enum back to ConthacksParser, and ConthacksParser will use this enum to call the respective `XYZCommandParser` to call and creates the respective `XYZCommand` object.

The following sequence diagram show how the parsing of alias works, using the example `ec 1 m/CS2100 T19` 

![Sequence diagram for parsing of alias](images/ParseAliasSequenceDiagram.png)

**Aspect: Previous and current version of commandWord:**

* **Alternative 1 (previous version):** The `commandWord` string for a `XYZCommand` is stored as an attribute in the `XYZCommand` class.
    * Pros: Simple implementation for `ConthacksParser` to check which `XYZCommandParser` to call.
    * Cons: Very difficult to add more `commandWord` for any `XYZCommand`. If the `XYZCommand` has multiple possible `commandWord`, we will need to add all to the attributes of `XYZCommand` and checking one by one is very difficult. 

* **Alternative 2 (current version):** Shift all the `commandWord` string of every `XYZCommand` into a `CommandWord` enum class. One enum in the `CommandWord` can contains multiple `commandWord` string. 
    * Pros: Easy to add a new alias (new commandWord) for any of the command. 
    * Cons: The implementation is more complex than alternative 1.
