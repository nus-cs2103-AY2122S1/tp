### Architecture

![image](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletestu 1`.

![image](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

![image](images\ComponentManagers.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `ClassListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` and `TutorialClass` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![image](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ClassmateParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletestu 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletestu 1` Command](images/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

![image](images/ParserClasses.png)

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ClassmateParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `ClassmateParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![image](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)


The `Model` component,

* stores the ClassMATE data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object), and all `TutorialClass` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTutorialClassList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` and `TutorialClass` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` and `ObservableList<TutorialClass>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ClassMATE`, which `Student` references. This allows `ClassMATE` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

![image](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![image](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,

* can save both ClassMATE data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ClassmateStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Tutorial Class Management Features

(Contributed by Rushil Ramesh and Vishnu Sundaresan)

ClassMATE allows the user to manage information relevant to the TutorialClass. A User is able to:

1. Add a new tutorial class
2. Delete an existing tutorial class
3. List all existing tutorial class
4. Find tutorial classes by their class codes (more [here](#class-and-tutorial-group-filters-features))
5. View Class Details

#### Current Implementation

The class `Classmate` facilitates all operations related to tutorial classes. It maintains a `UniqueTutorialClassList`
of containing all tutorial classes, as well as a `FliteredList` of `TutorialClass` instances reflecting the current
state of the tutorial class list to be displayed to the user. The `Classmate` contains a summary of all the logic of the
tutorial class commands (e.g. `AddClassCommand`)  executed on the `UniqueTutorialCLassList`.

The following operations are implemented:

* `Classmate#hasTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)` - Checks if tutorial class is in ClassMATE
* `Classmate#addTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)` - Adds tutorial Class to ClassMATE
* `Classmate#removeTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)` - Deletes existing tutorial class from ClassMATE
* `Classmate#getTutorialClassList()` - Displays entire list of tutorial classes.
* `Model#updateFilteredTutorialClassList(Predicate<TutorialClass> predicate)` - Searches for tutorial class by keyword and displays filtered list.
* `Model#updateUnfilteredStudentList(List<Student> students)` - Updates list of students when a class is deleted.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)`,
`Model#addTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)`, `Model#deleteTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)` and
`Model#getTutorialClass()`respectively.

Given below is an example of how the tutorial class features can be used:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UniqueTutorialClassList` would be derived from the
initial ClassMATE state, and all tutorial classes stored will be displayed.

Step 2. The user executes an `addc c/G01 s/Tuesday 12:00pm to 2:00pm, Friday 12:00pm to 2:00pm` command. The `addc` command calls `Model#addTutorialClass()`, adding a new tutorial class to ClassMATE. This modifies and saves the
state of ClassMATE. The updated `UniqueTutorialClassList` will be displayed in the `ClassListPanel`
to the user.

Step 3. The user executes a  `viewc 1` command. The `viewc` command updates the `filteredTutorialClasses` to only display the class at the
given index, and updates the `filteredStudents` to contain only the students who are in the selected class. The updated filtered list of
students and tutorial classes will be displayed to the user.

Step 4. The user executes a `deletec 2` command. The `deletec` command calls `Model#deleteTutorialCLass()`, modifying and saving the
state of ClassMATE by deleting the class stored at the given index in the `FilteredList`. The students from the deleted class are no longer part of the deleted
class and left with a displayed class code of `No Class`. The tutorial groups that were part of the class will be deleted. This updated list will be displayed to the user.

Step 5. The user executes a `listc` command. The `listc` command calls `Model#updateFilteredTutorialClassList()` modifying and saving the state of the `FilteredList`
to contain all tutorial classes in ClassMATE. This updated list will be displayed to the user.

Using the example of the `AddClassCommand`,
when the user enters the `addc` command to add a tutorial class, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in [Logic component](#logic-component).
During the parsing, a new TutorialClass instance is created. This `TutorialClass` instance will be received by the `AddClassCommand` when it is created.
The command is then executed, adding the new class to ClassMATE

The *Sequence Diagram* below summarises the aforementioned steps in the execution of the command.

![AddClassSequenceDiagram](images/AddClassSequenceDiagram.png)<br>
Execution of the `AddClassCommand`

#### Design Considerations

#### Aspect: Student and Tutorial Class lists

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use two separate lists to store students and tutorial classes
  * Pros: Faster, simpler command executions for student and tutorial class commands.
    Easier to maintain overall. Therefore, all students and all tutorial classes can be accessed independent of each other.
  * Cons: Class specific student commands are slower. For example a user is required to `viewc` in order to filter just the students in the class,
    increasing the overall time
* Alternative 2: Nesting of students within Tutorial Class
  * Pros: Faster in class specific student commands and students are better organised.
  * Cons: Complexity of tutorial classes is increased and slower to navigate to view other tutorial classes or perform general commands on the students

### Student Management Features

(Contributed by Rushil Ramesh)

ClassMATE allows the user to manage information about Students. The user is able to:

1. Add a student
1. Edit an existing student
1. View a student's details
1. Delete a student
1. List all students
1. Find students by name

#### Current Implementation

`Classmate` facilitates all operations related to students. It maintains a `UniqueStudentList` consisting of all students as well as a
separate `FilteredList` of students in `ModelManager` that reflect the current state of the student list to be displayed to the user. `Classmate` contains the logic related to
managing students, and summarises the various student related commands.

The following operations are supported by ClassMATE:

* `Classmate#hasStudent(Student student)` - Checks if a student is in ClassMATE
* `Classmate#addStudent(Student student)` - Adds a student to ClassMATE
* `Classmate#setStudent(Student student, Student editedStudent)` - Edits a student's details
* `Classmate#removeStudent(Student student)` - Deletes existing student from ClassMATE
* `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate<Student> predicate)` - Searches for a student by given keyword and displays filtered list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface, which call methods of `Classmate` and `FilteredList`.

Given below is an example of how the student features could be used by the user:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UniqueStudentList` would be derived from the initial ClassMATE state, and
all students stored will be displayed with their details.

Step 2. The user creates a tutorial class by using the `addc` command, for example `addc c/G01 s/Tuesday 12:00pm to 2:00pm, Friday 12:00pm to 2:00pm`.
The newly created tutorial class will be displayed in the `ClassListPanel` to the user. Refer to [Tutorial Class Management Features](#tutorial-class-management-features)
section for more information on tutorial classes.

Step 3. The user executes a `addstu n/Johnny Tay p/98989898 a/26 Clementi Avenue 6 e/johnnytay@email.com c/G01` command. The `addstu` command executes the
`AddStudentCommand`, which in turn calls the `Model#addStudent()` command to add a new student to ClassMATE. The student is added to the recently create `G01` class.
The updated `UniqueStudentList` will be displayed to users on the `StudentListPanel`.

Step 4. The user executes a `findstu Johnny` command. The `findstu` command calls the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` method which
modifies the state of the `FilteredList` of students. The updated filtered list containing the students whose names match the query keywords will
be displayed to the user. Users will have to type one of the student's names to find a particular student (e.g. `findstu Tay` will also filter our newly added student)

Step 5. The user executes a `viewstu 1` command. The `viewstu` command causes a pop-up window to appear, displaying the details of the selected student, such as the
groups the student is in and the class participation marks for previous lessons. Any movements to the main screen would result in this window closing.

Step 6. The user executes a `deletestu 2` command. The `deletestu` command calls the `Model#deleteStudent()` function. This executes a `DeleteStudentCommand`,
which deletes a student currently in the second index of the `FitleredList`. This modifies and saves the state of ClassMATE, displaying the updated list of students
to the user.

Step 7. the user executes a `liststu` command. The command calls the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` function by setting the predicate of the
`FilteredList` to `true` for all students. The updated list consisting of all students in ClassMATE is then displayed to the user.

The logic flow of executing a student command can be best illustrated using the `FindStudentCommand`. When the enters the `findstu`
command to find a Student whose name matches the given keyword, the user input undergoes the same command parsing
as described in the [Logic component](#logic-component) section. During the parsing, a new `NameCOntainsKeywordsPredicate` is created,
which will be received by the `FindStudentCommand`. The execution of a command sets the`Predicate` of the `FilteredList` of students
to the parsed predicate, updating the list that is displayed.

The *Sequence Diagram* below summarises the aforementioned steps in the execution of the command.

![FindStudentSequenceDiagram](images/FindStudentSequenceDiagram.png)<br>
Execution of the `FindStudentCommand`

#### Design Considerations

#### Aspect: Adding Students to ClassMATE

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Add a student with a compulsory `CLASS_CODE` parameter
  * Pros: This was the most intuitive option, as users only need add students assigned to their classes. Therefore, requiring users
    to create a class before adding a student prevents the case where students are added without a class
  * Cons: This increases the command length for the user, increasing the time taken for the user to type the command.
* Alternative 2: Add a student independent of whether the tutorial class has been created
  * Pros: Users are able to create a student without having to take the additional step of creating a class, and shorter command
    length means higher typing speeds for users.
  * Cons: This would require an additional command to add students to a class, which decreases the efficiency of the program.

#### Aspect: Display of Student Information

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Display a summary of user information in the List and more details upon viewing the student.
  * Pros: This reduces cluttering in the student display panel and presents the necessary information to the user in the list. User has the option to
    focus on a particular student and view additional details if they need to.
  * Cons: This necessitates the creation of an additional `viewc` command for users to be able to view this data.

* Alternative 2: Present all student information in the student list itself.
  * Pros: All student information can be seen in one place without having to use additional commands to access information.
  * Cons: This is not visually appealing and provides information in a cluttered manner to the user, reducing the overall
    quality of the user's experience using the application.

### Student Participation Mark Features

(Contributed by Vishnu Sundaresan)

ClassMATE allows the user to manage information about Class Participation grading relevant to each Student. A User is able to:

1. Add a weekly participation mark
2. Delete a weekly participation mark
3. Delete all weekly participation marks

#### Proposed Implementation

Each Student will contain a `List` known as `marks` that will store all participation mark values for the Student. This list is internally stored as an `ArrayList`. Using an `Enumeration` of Student Marks, which contains the following Marks:

* `POOR` (0 marks)
* `LOW` (1 mark)
* `AVG` (2 marks)
* `GOOD` (3 marks)
* `HIGH` (4 marks)
* `EXCELLENT` (5 marks)

ClassMATE will then support the following command classes:

* `AddLastMarkCommand(Index index, StudentMark mark)`
* `DeleteLastMarkCommand(Index index)`
* `DeleteAllMarksCommand(Index index)`

These commands inherit from the `Command` class, and are named accordingly.

Given below is an example of how the student marks features can be used:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The existing `marks` list would be derived from the
initial ClassMATE state, and all students stored will be displayed along with their currently stored marks below their name

Step 2. The user executes an `addm 1 m/low` command. After the Command has been parsed, the `addm` command calls `AddLastMarkCommand#addStudentMark()`  and subsequently `Model#setStudent()` and `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()`, adding the mark provided (`LOW` in this case) to Classmate. This modifies and saves the state of ClassMATE. The updated `UniqueStudentList` will be displayed in the `ClassListPanel` to the user.

Step 3. The user executes a `deletelm 1` command. The `deletelm` command calls the `DeleteLastMarkCommand#deleteLastStudentMark()` and subsequently the`Model#setStudent()` and the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()`, modifying the state of the filtered list of students. The updated filtered list consists the students with the latest mark removed from the 1st student.

​																						**Before `deletelm` command**

![StudentMarkState1](images/StudentMarksState1.png)

​																						**After `deletelm` command**

![StudentMarkState2](images/StudentMarksState2.png)

Step 4. The user executes a `deleteam 1` command. The `deleteam` command calls `DeleteAllMarkCommand#deleteAllStudentMark()`, then subsequently `Model#setStudent()`and `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()`, modifying and saving the state of ClassMATE by deleting all marks for the 1st student at the given index in the `UniqueStudentList`. This updated list will be displayed to the user.

Using the example of the `AddMarkCommand`,
when the user enters the `addm` command to add a tutorial class, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in [“Logic component”](#logic-component).
During the parsing, a new `Student` instance is created. This `Student` instance will be received by the `AddMarkCommand` when it is created.

The *Sequence Diagram* below summarizes the aforementioned steps.

![AddMarkSequenceDiagram](images/AddMarkSequenceDiagram.png)

Execution of the `AddMarkCommand`

#### Design Considerations

#### Aspect: Rationale for studentMarks size

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Keep a list of variable length
  * Pros: Flexible, allows instructors not to worry about the number of tutorials taken.
  * Cons: Prone to human error of counting, not tallying within strict 26 tutorial-limit.
* Alternative 2: Keep a fixed-size list of 26
  * Pros: Since there are 13 weeks and two tutorials a week, there will be a projected 26 tutorials held. Thus, a fixed size of 26 elements will allow the list to reflect this requirement.
  * Cons: Instructors are limited to this 26-class limit, and cannot store marks for extra tutorials/make-up sessions.

#### Aspect: Display of Marks

* Alternative 1: Display as a list under student credentials in each student card
  * Pros: Simple to implement, easily viewed
  * Cons: Unable to fit all marks, lack of earlier mark visibility
* Alternative 2 (current choice): Display in `viewstu` command as separate feature
  * Pros: Can view all marks at once, clear to understand
  * Cons: Marks can only be viewed for one student at a time

### ClassCode Features

(Contributed by Zhou Yirui)

ClassMATE allows user to assign a Student or a Tutorial Group to a Tutorial Class using a ClassCode. A user is able to:

1. Add ClassCode to a student
2. Edit ClassCode of a student
3. Create Tutorial Group using ClassCode
4. Create Tutorial Classes using ClassCode

#### Current Implementation

The class `ClassCode` facilitates all operations related to classCode. `ClassCode` is implemented such that a
Tutorial Class with the corresponding `ClassCode` must exist before the `ClassCode` can be added. Tutorial Class `G00` is a
default class that do not need to be created and is an empty `ClassCode`. It is assigned to a Student whose Tutorial Class has been deleted. 

Given below is an example of how `ClassCode` can be used.

Step 1: After launching the application for the first time, user executes `addstu n/Abigail p/91199119 e/ab@gmail.com a/Downling Park #15-20 c/G08`.
The `addstu` command calls `Model#hasTutorialClass()`, and the model component checks if the TutorialClass specified by the
class code exists. If it exists, the student is added successfully with the classCode parameter `G08`, else, an error message is given.

Step 2: The user deletes TutorialClass G08 using the `deletec c/G08` command. The `deletec` command changes the ClassCode of all students
of TutorialClass `G08` to `G00`. On ClassMATE, the UI reflects the Student to have no Tutorial Class, i.e. `No class`.

### Tutorial Group Management Features

This feature is split into two parts.

* Adding/removing tutorial group to tutorial class (Contributed by Ngu Yi Yang)
* Adding/removing student to tutorial group. (Contributed by Zhou Yirui)

ClassMATE allows the user to manage information relevant to the TutorialGroup. A User is able to:

1. Add a new tutorial group to an existing tutorial class
2. Remove an existing tutorial group from an existing tutorial class
3. Add a student to an existing tutorial group
4. Remove a student from tutorial group

#### Current Implementation (Adding/removing tutorial group to tutorial class)

The class `Classmate` facilitates all operations related to tutorial groups. It maintains a
`UniqueTutorialClassList` containing all tutorial classes, where each `TutorialClass` maintains a `UniqueTutorialGroupList` containing its tutorial groups.
`Classmate` contains a summary of all the logic of the interaction between tutorial group and tutorial class such as
adding tutorial groups to tutorial classes (e.g. `AddGroupCommand`)  executed on the `UniqueTutorialGroupList`.

The following operations are implemented which highlight the interactions between subcomponents within `Model`
related to adding a tutorial group to a class:

* `UniqueTutorialClassList#contains(TutorialClass toCheck)`  - Checks if tutorial class exists
* `UniqueTutorialClassList#contains(TutorialGroup toCheck)`  - Checks if tutorial group is in any of the tutorial classes
* `TutorialClass#isSameTutorialClass(TutorialClass tutorialClass)`  - Checks if two tutorial classes are the same. They are the same if their Class codes are the same.  
* `TutorialGroup#isSameTutorialGroup(TutorialClass tutorialGroup)`  - Checks if two tutorial groups are the same. They are the same if their Class codes, Group number and Group type are the same.
* `UniqueTutorialClassList#add(TutorialGroup toAdd)`  - Finds the tutorial group list of the tutorial class to add the tutorial group to
* `UniqueTutorialGroupList#add(TutorialGroup toAdd)`  - Adds tutorial group to the tutorial group list of a class
* `TutorialClass#getTutorialGroups()`  - Retrieves the list of tutorial groups within the TutorialClass
* `TutorialClass#createTestTutorialClass(ClassCode classCode)`  - Creates a dummy tutorial class with the class code of the tutorial group for checking

Given below is an example of how the tutorial group features can be used:

Step 1. The user executes an `addcg gn/1 c/G06 type/OP1` command. The `addcg` command calls `Model#hasTutorialClass()`,
and the model component checks if the tutorial class specified by the class code exists and throws an exception if it does not.
It then checks whether the tutorial group already exists using `Model#hasTutorialGroup()`and calls `Model#addTutorialGroup()` if it does not.

The checking of whether the tutorial class and tutorial group already exists is implemented as such:
`Classmate` calls the `contains` method of its `UniqueTutorialClassList`. This method is overloaded to accept
either a `TutorialClass` or `TutorialGroup`. The difference between the implementation of these two is that for the former,
it checks through its list of tutorial classes by utilising streams and the `TutorialClass#isSameTutorialClass()` method.

For the latter, it uses `TutorialClass#createTestTutorialClass(ClassCode classCode)`
to create the tutorial class representing the one that the tutorial group is being added to so that it can then retrieve that tutorial class
within the `UniqueTutorialClassList`. Since the checking of whether the tutorial class exists is done beforehand,
the tutorial class is guaranteed to exist and is retrieved. From the tutorial class, its `UniqueTutorialGroupList` is retrieved using the method `TutorialClass#getTutorialGroups()`.
It then checks whether tutorial group already exists by utilising streams and the `TutorialGroup#isSameTutorialGroup()` method.

Adding of tutorial groups is similar; `UniqueTutorialClassList#add(TutorialGroup toAdd)` retrieves the tutorial class from the `UniqueTutorialClassList` and its `UniqueTutorialGroupList`,
in order to add the tutorial group using `UniqueTutorialGroupList#add(TutorialGroup toAdd)`.

This modifies and saves the state of ClassMATE.

Step 2. The user executes a `deletecg c/G06 gn/1 type/OP1` command. The `deletecg` command works in the same way as the `addcg`
command, except it removes that tutorial group from ClassMATE after checking if it exists. It also removes all students
in that tutorial group.

Using the example of the `AddGroupCommand`,
when the user enters the `addcg` command to add a tutorial group, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in [“Logic component”](#logic-component).
During the parsing, a new `TutorialGroup` instance is created. This `TutorialGroup` instance will be received by the `AddGroupCommand` when it is created.

The *Sequence Diagram* below summarizes how tutorial groups are added to a tutorial class.

![AddGroupSequenceDiagram](images/AddGroupSequenceDiagram.png)

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how `UniqueTutorialClassList` retrieves the
`UniqueTutorialGroupList` from the specified TutorialClass for checking or adding of a given tutorial group.

![GetTutorialGroupsDiagram](images/GetTutorialGroupsDiagram.png)


#### Design Considerations

#### Aspect: Storing Tutorial Groups as lists

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Storing tutorial groups in their respective tutorial classes
  * Pros: Faster when performing find functions such as finding tutorial groups in a particular class. Tutorials groups are also better organised.
  * Cons: Splitting groups based on a category makes it harder to extend to support filtering groups with a different category from what is implemented.

* Alternative 2: Use a single list to store all tutorial groups.
  * Pros: Simpler to implement, easier to add or remove tutorial groups.
    Storing tutorial groups as arrays in JSON is less complicated.
  * Cons: Searching or filtering the list of tutorial groups by group types may take a longer time.

#### Current Implementation (Adding/Removing Student from Tutorial Group)

Each Student contains a `Set` of `TutorialGroup` they belong to. Tutorial Groups are stored internally as a `HashSet`. The `HashSet` of
`TutorialGroup` is implemented such that there are no duplicate `TutorialGroup`, and each Student belongs to at most 1 `TutorialGroup` of 
each Group Type. 

ClassMATE will then support the following command classes:

* `AddStudentToGroupCommand(Index index, TutorialGroup tutorialGroup)`
* `DeleteStudentFromGroupCommand(Index index, TutorialGroup tutorialGroup)`

Given below is an example of how the Add and Delete Student from Tutorial Groups features can be used:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The existing set of `TutorialGroup` for each Student would be retrieved from the initial
ClassMATE state, and would be displayed with the details the Student. 

Step 2. The user enters `liststu` to list all the existing Students in ClassMATE

Step 3. The user executes `addsg 1 gn/1 c/G06 type/OP1`. After the Command has been parsed, the `addsg` command calls `AddStudentToGroup#addTutorialGroup()`. 
Subsequently, `Model#setStudent` and `Classmate#setStudent` are called consecutively to update the `TutorialGroup` of the Student.
During the execution of `AddStudentToGroupCommand`, a new `Student` instance with the edited set of `TutorialGroup` is created.

#### Design Considerations

#### Aspect: Student parameters in the Command

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Identifying the Student using Index. 
  * Pros: Easier to implement. Less ambiguity arising from Students with the same names. 
  * Cons: Adding/Deleting a Student from a Tutorial Group takes a longer time. Filtering the Student list may be necessary.

* Alternative 2: Identifying the Student using a Student ID. 
  * Pros: Faster to perform the action of adding/deleting a Student from Tutorial Group. 
  * Cons: Utility of Student ID is low as it is not used by other Commands. Also more difficult to implement.

### Class and Tutorial Group Filters Features

(Contributed by Gabriel Waikin Loh Matienzo)

ClassMATE allows the user to filter students based on tutorial groups and find. A user is able to:

1. View all students in a class
2. View all students in a group

#### Proposed Implementation

Using the Predicate class `ClassCodeContainsKeywordsPredicate`(implemented by Vishnu), which finds a specific class given a class code as well as implementing a `GroupMember Predicate` that filters for students in a particular tutorial group, `Model#updateFilteredStudentList` is used to display a new list of students from a particular class or tutorial group.

ClassMATE will then support the following command classes:

* `FindClassCommand(ClassCode classCode)`
* `ViewGroupCommand(ClassCode classCode, GroupNumber groupNumber, GroupType groupType)`

These commands inherit from the `Command` class, and are named accordingly.

Given below is an example of how the class and group filter features can be used:

Step 1. The user has at least one class and at least one group in that class. The user executes a `findc G01` command. During parsing the `findc` command creates a `ClassCodeContainsKeywordsPredicate` that is used to call `Model#updateFilteredClassList()` to filter for `TutorialClass`(s) with the same class code(s) as the one(s) specified. Before this, the `findc` command also checks if there is no such `TutorialClass` and returns an error if there is none. If there are no errors, the state of the filtered list of tutorial classes is updated, and the updated filtered list will display the results of the search query to the user.

Step 2. The user executes a `viewg c/G01 type/OP1 gn/1` command. After parsing the command, the `viewg` command first checks if there exists a `TutorialClass` with the specified class code. the `viewg` command checks if there exists a `TutorialGroup` with the specified class code, group type and group number. After all the checks pass, the `viewg` command calls `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` to filter for students who belong to the `TutorialGroup` with the specified parameters. This updates the state of the filtered list of students, and the updated filtered list will display the results of the search query to the user.

#### Design Considerations

#### Aspect: Finding Tutorial Classes

* Alternative 1 : Find tutorial classes by filtering for all tutorial classes with class codes containing the given keyword.
  * Pros: Shorter keywords may increase user typing speed slightly, and user is able to find multiple classes at once.
  * Cons: The increase in user typing speed may be marginal and negligible, as users may only save time not typing 1 character as the class codes are 3 characters long and all class codes begin with G. Additionally, the search will have lower accuracy as you may see up to 10 classes for a two character search e.g. `G0`.
* Alternative 2 (current choice): Find tutorial classes by their exact class code
  * Pros: Higher Accuracy in search, and since class codes are only three characters long, it does not cause users to take significantly more time.
  * Cons: Keywords used in searches can only match specific classes instead of finding multiple classes at once.
