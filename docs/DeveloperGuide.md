### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/Central Library`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java) interface and implements its functionality using the [`LogicManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic) class which follows the `Logic` interface.
Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudySpotListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `StudySpot` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `StudyTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a `StudySpot`).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete n/Central Library")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete n/Central Library` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `StudyTrackerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `StudyTrackerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="750" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the study tracker data i.e., all `StudySpot` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudySpotList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `StudySpot` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<StudySpot>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `StudyTracker`, which `StudySpot` references. This allows `StudyTracker` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `StudySpot` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both study tracker data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `StudyTrackerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

 
### Alias feature

#### Overview

The Alias command supports user-defined aliases for commands.
These aliases are string values that will be replaced by commands (i.e. *command expansion*) during the execution of command.

Aliases are stored in the `UserPrefs` object.

#### Key terms

* **Aliases**â€‰â€” A user-specified string that is mapped to a **command**.
  Aliases **cannot** be defined to existing command words.
* **Commands**â€‰â€” A command must contain exactly one command word, all compulsory arguments and optional arguments if 
  indicated. 
  When executed, an action is performed.
* **Command Words**â€‰â€” The main "verbs" representing commands in StudyTracker.
  A command word by itself is a **command**.
  
  Example: `list`, `edit`, `find` are command words.

* **Well-formed command**â€‰â€” A command is well-formed if it has exactly one command word (or alias) and optional arguments.

    Examples:
  
    * `list` - well-formed
    * `add n/Starbucks` â€‰â€”â€‰ well-formed, since it contains command word `add` and argument `n/Starbucks`.
    However, it is invalid (i.e. will throw and error when executed), since it is missing required argument `rating`.
    * `myAdd t/cold` â€‰â€”â€‰ well-formed, since it contains alias `myAdd` and argument `t/cold`.
  `myAdd` will itself expand to another well-formed command (by definition of Alias).
    * `add list find n/Starbucks r/5` â€‰â€”â€‰ not well-formed, since it has 3 command words (only should have one).
    * `myAdd add n/Starbucks r/5` â€‰â€”â€‰ not well-formed, since it has both 1 alias and 1 command word (only should have one).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation of Alias feature

The Alias feature is facilitated by three key classes: `Alias.java`, `StudyTrackerParser.java`, and `UserPrefs.java`.

`Alias.java` is responsible for creating new Aliases. It implements the following operations:

* `Alias#isValidUserAlias()`â€‰â€”â€‰checks if Alias is valid (i.e whether it is a command word)
* `Alias#isValidCommandWord()`â€‰â€”â€‰checks if Alias maps to a valid command word in the StudyTracker list of commands.

`StudyTrackerParser.java` is responsible for parsing user commands. The key operations needed for Aliases are:

* `StudyTrackerParser#isInvokingAlias()`â€‰â€”â€‰ checks if the user input is a normal command, or one that invokes an Alias belonging in `UserPrefs`.  
* `StudyTrackerParser#expandAlias()`â€‰â€”â€‰ parses the Alias into its corresponding command.
StudyTrackerParser will prepend the arguments from the expanded command before the arguments in user input, if any.

`UserPrefs.java` is responsible for storing and reading Aliases from disk. The key operations needed for Aliases are:
* `UserPrefs#getUserAliases()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns the list of Aliases defined by the user. 
* `UserPrefs#setUserAliases()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current list of Aliases defined by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Alias feature behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The program loads with default Aliases.

![AliasState0](images/AliasState0.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 2.** The user executes `alias al/myAdd cmd/add r/5 n/` which creates an alias `myAdd` with command `add r/5 n/`.
The `alias` command calls `Model#addAlias()`, adding this newly created alias to the Model and in UserPrefs.

![AliasState1](images/AliasState1.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** Observe how the command is incomplete!
It is a well-formed command, but requires the completion of the `n/` argument to be valid.

However, this is allowed, as it is one of the key features for the flexibility of the Alias feature.
</div>

**Step 3.** The user executes `myAdd Starbucks t/cold` to add a new study spot.
Within `StudyTrackerParser`, alias parsing takes place by fetching user alias information in `Model`.

The command is expanded to `add r/5 n/Starbucks t/cold`.
The string is then passed to the corresponding `AddCommandParser`, and an `AddCommand` is created.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how StudyTrackerParser parses the input with this new `myAdd` alias:

![AliasSequenceDiagram](images/AliasSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** If a command fails its execution, the respective CommandParser will throw a `ParseException`.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** This sequence diagram does not show the subsequent execution of the created AddCommand.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/AliasActivityDiagram.png" width="350" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: What aliases should be allowed:**

* **Alternative 1:** Aliases only map to a single command word.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Not particularly useful for the user.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Aliases can map to commands, not just command words.
    * Pros: User has more freedom to implement powerful commands.
    * Cons: Implementation is slightly more challenging.
    
* **Alternative 3:** Aliases can map to commands, including other aliases.
    * Pros: User has even more freedom.
    * Cons: Implementation is much more challenging (e.g. how to prevent recursion?).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Log feature

#### Overview

The number of hours that a user spends at a StudySpot is shown on the GUI. It is saved as a field of `StudySpot`, known
as `StudiedHours`. This number can be changed by making use of the Log feature.


#### Implementation of Log feature

The Log feature is facilitated by `LogCommand.java`, `StudiedHours.java`.

`StudiedHours.java` is a statistical field in `StudySpot`. It is responsible for storing the hours a user studies at a
StudySpot. It implements the following operations: 
- `StudiedHours#isValidLoggedHours()` -- checks if a given input in a Log Command is a positive integer, and that there
is no integer overflow.
- `StudiedHours#addHours(StudiedHours toBeAdded)` -- Takes in another `StudiedHours` and adds the two values
 together, returning a new `StudiedHour`. It also ensures that there is no integer overflow.

`LogCommand.java` is responsible for changing the `StudiedHours` field in a given `StudySpot` (given by its `Name`). 
It has 4 different ways of doing so:
- By default, it adds the given input value to the current value.
    - E.g. If the current StudiedHours is 4, and the user logs 3 more hours, it adds 4 and 3 together to give 7 hours.
- By using the `-o` flag in the input, it **overrides** the original value and replaces it with the given value.
    - E.g. If the current StudiedHours is 4, and the user logs 3 with the `-o` flag, it will override the existing 4
      and replace it with 3.
- By using the `-r` flag in the input, it **resets** the original value to 0.
    - E.g. If the current StudiedHours is 4, and the user logs with the `-r` flag, the value will be reset to 0.
- By using the `-ra` flag in the input, it **resets** the original value of ALL `StudySpot`'s to 0.
    - E.g. If the user logs with the `-ra` flag, all values will be reset to 0.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
    
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Log feature behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application. The program loads with the given `StudySpot`'s.

![PartialStudyTrackerDiagram](images/PartialStudyTracker.png)

Step 2. The user executes `log -r n/Starbucks UTown` which resets the `StudiedHours` at Starbucks to 0.

Step 3. After studying for 3 hours at Starbucks, the user executes `log n/Starbucks UTown hr/5`, which adds 5 hours to 0,
 resulting in the `StudiedHours` to become 5.

Step 4. The user realises he made a mistake, and executes `log -o n/Starbucks UTown hr/3`, which hard changes the 
`StudiedHours` to 3.
   
Step 5. The user wants to reset all `StudiedHours` to 0, so the user executes the command `log -ra`.
   
The following sequence diagram demonstrates the flow from the given input:

![LogSequenceDiagram](images/LogSequenceDiagram.png)

![LogSequenceDiagramOverride](images/LogSequenceDiagramWithFlagO.png)

Sequence diagram for `-r` flag is the same as `-o` but with handleReset() instead of handleOverride()

![LogSequenceDiagramResetAll](images/LogSequenceDiagramWithFlagRA.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![LogActivityDiagram](images/LogActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

Initially, Log Command was designed for users to keep track of how long they studied somewhere, and was supposed to 
only add the value provided by the user to the current value (which is the default behaviour of the log command).

Some things were considered while implementing the Log Command:
1. What if a user enters an incorrect input?
2. What happens if there is an integer overflow for the number of hours?
3. Should users be able to change logged hours with Edit command?

To tackle these issues, the following solutions were implemented:
1. Introduction of flags
    - Two useful flags, `-o` for override, and `-r` for reset.
    - Use of these flags will result in a simpler solution that is user-friendly too.
2. Limiting the number of hours that each `StudySpot` can hold
    - Prohibiting the addition of hours exceeding `INTEGER_MAX_VALUE`, which is already an unreasonable 
      amount of hours to be studying anyway.
    - Furthermore, if a user wishes to log more hours while already having `INTEGER_MAX_VALUE`hours at a location,
    it will prompt the user to use either `-o` or `-r` to set or reset the value.
3. Disallowing Edit to change logged hours
    - Log is intended to be a command for users to use at the end of a study session at a study spot, if they wish
    to keep track of how long they studied there.
    - Using Edit on `StudiedHours` should provide a similar effect to the `-o` flag of Log, it was agreed that it was
     not natural and unintuitive to use Edit for this purpose.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Operating Hours
#### Overview

Operating hours allow users to specify the opening and closing hours of a study spot.

#### Implementation

Operating hours is facilitated by these classes: `OperatingHours.java`, `StudySpot.java`, `AddCommand.java`
and `EditCommand.java`.

`OperatingHours.java` is responsible for creating `OperatingHours` objects. A `StudySpot` object contains 
an `operatingHours` attribute. A study spot with an `OperatingHours` object can be initialised with an Add command 
or the `operatingHours` attribute can be edited with an Edit command.

Given below is an example usage scenario of adding a study spot with operating hours and how the mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user executes `add n/com r/5 o/0900-2200, 0900-1800` to add a new study spot. `StudyTrackerParser` class
creates an `AddCommandParser` to parse the command. Since operating hours are provided in the command, 
`ParserUtil#parseOperatingHours(String operatingHours)` is called. An `AddCommand` object with the study spot to be 
added is then created.

The following object diagram illustrates the `OperatingHours` object created.

![Add OperatingHoursObjectDiagram](images/AddOperatingHoursObjectDiagram.png)


Step 2. `LogicManager` executes the `AddCommand` object, calling `Model#addStudySpot(StudySpot studySpot)` so that 
a new study spot is added to the model in StudyTracker.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how `StudyTrackerParser` parses the command.

![Add OperatingHoursSequenceDiagram](images/AddOperatingHoursSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Amenities 
#### Overview

Users are able to add amenities such as wifi, food, aircon and charger to a study spot.

#### Implementation

Amenity is facilitated by these classes: `Amenity.java`, `StudySpot.java`, `AddCommand.java` and `EditCommand.java`.

`Amenity.java` is responsible for creating `Amenity` objects. A `StudySpot` object contains
an `amenities` attribute. A study spot with an `Amenity` object can be initialised with an Add command
or the `amenities` attribute can be edited with an Edit command.

Given below is an example usage scenario of adding a study spot with the wifi amenity and how the mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user executes `add n/COM1 r/5 m/wifi` to add a new study spot. `StudyTrackerParser` class
creates an `AddCommandParser` to parse the command. Since an amenity is provided in the command,
`ParserUtil#parseAmenity(String amenity)` is called. An `AddCommand` object with the study spot to be
added is then created.

Step 2. `LogicManager` executes the `AddCommand` object, calling `Model#addStudySpot(StudySpot studySpot)` so that
a new study spot is added to the model in StudyTracker.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how `StudyTrackerParser` parses the command.

![Add AmenitySequenceDiagram](images/AddAmenitySequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Enhanced List Command
#### Overview

The List Command is enhanced to support filtering of favourites, tags, amenities and rating.

#### Implementation

The `Model` component stores the currently 'selected' `StudySpot` objects as a separate filtered list. The filter of this list can be updated using `Model#updateFilteredStudySpotList(Predicate<StudySpot> predicate)`.

The following activity diagram outlines the general parsing and execution of a ListCommand.

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Upon entering a command, the user's input command is parsed and a `ListCommandParser` is created. 
The parser looks out for flags given in the user's input and checks if the associated parameters are given correctly
`ListCommandParser` then creates a `ListCommand` object with a `Predicate<StudySpot>` that tests for 
the specified conditions by the user. `Logic Manager` proceeds to execute `ListCommand` and a `CommandResult` object
is created. The result is returned to `Logic Manager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves at every step.

Step 1. The user executes `list -f` command to show all favourites in the StudyTracker. `StudyTrackerParser` class
creates a `ListCommandParser` to parse the command and creates a `ListCommand` object with a `Predicate<StudySpot>`
that filters for favourite `StudySpots`.


Step 2. `LogicManager` executes the `ListCommand` object, calling 
`Model#updateFilteredStudySpotList(Predicate<StudySpot> predicate)`. This updates the model in StudyTracker to show
only favourite `StudySpots` to the user. 

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how `StudyTrackerParser` parses the command.

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Behaviour of filters with multiple tags:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filtering by tags show study spots that all specified tags.
* **Alternative 2:** Filtering by tags show study spots that contain at least one of the specified tags.

The current choice was chosen as it is intuitive and most modern desktop applications follow this behaviour. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Enhanced Edit Command

#### Overview

The Edit Command is enhanced to support the removal of specific tags and amenities.

#### Implementation

The Edit Command is facilitated by two classes: `EditCommand.java` and `EditCommandParser.java`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of removing a tag from a study spot and how the mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user executes `edit spot/com rt/noisy` to remove the Tag `noisy` from the StudySpot `com`. 
`StudyTrackerParser` then parses this input and creates an `EditCommand` object.

Step 2. `LogicManager` executes the `EditCommand` object and updates the model in StudyTracker with the edited study
spot.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates how `StudyTrackerParser` parses the command.

![Edit RemoveTagSequenceDiagram](images/EditRemoveTagSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to increase the ease of removing fields in a study spot:**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Users can directly remove a tag or an amenity they specify.
- **Alternative 2**: Users have to retype existing tags or amenities if they wish to retain them.


### Themes

#### Overview

Themes allow users to customize the colours of the GUI of StudyTracker.

![GUI Themes](images/UiThemes.png)

#### Implementation of Themes

The GuiSettings class handles information about GUI width, height, position, and theme.
These settings are stored by `UserPrefs` in the Model.

Themes are stored as Strings representing the theme name.
For example, `"default"` represents the default theme.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `MainWindow` Ui component communicates with the Logic class to read and write the currently selected theme.
Then, the `MainWindow` takes the stored theme and injects the corresponding CSS file to set the colours of the JavaFX app.

In the example, `"default"` will be parsed to `ThemeDefault.css`, which is injected into the JavaFX stage.

The following activity diagram summarizes the process of customizing themes.

![Themes Activity Diagram](images/ThemesActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Themes style guide

Each theme file is named `Theme[Themenamesentencecase].css`

It contains 8 theme colours, utilizing CSS variables support of JavaFX.

The following are examples showing the `Default` and `DotsDark` theme.

![Themes default](images/ThemeDefault.png)
![Themes dotsdark](images/ThemeDotsDark.png)

* `-fx-base` â€” base colour of the theme and StudyTracker GUI
* `fg-surface` â€” surface colour to place primary content
* `bg-surface` â€” surface colour to place secondary content
* `fg-accent` â€” contrasting colour to act as accenting colour
* `fg-text`, `bg-text`, `accent-text` â€” text colour for `fg-surface`, `bg-surface` and `fg-accent` respectively.
* `button` â€” button colour
