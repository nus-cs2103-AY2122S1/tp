  <h1> CohortConnect v1.4 </h1>

  <b> Type. Explore. Connect. </b>
</div>

<br><br>

CohortConnect is an advanced desktop address book which facilitates networking among Computer Science (CS) students. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

With advanced features for managing large groups of contacts, CohortConnect is intended for use in a university setting. At the start of the semester, professors will distribute `csv` or `json` files containing a list of students. Instantly load them into CohortConnect with a single **Import** command. With data collected from students before the semester, our **Find A Buddy** feature helps you find potential groupmates by leveraging GitHub’s metadata using a proprietary algorithm. In the **Events** tab, you can identify events and hackathons that your peers will be attending.

## Design

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
![Structure of the Window Components](images/UiWindowsDiagram.png)
![Structure of the OtherComponents](images/UiOtherComponentsDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow` and `WelcomeWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Storage` component,
* saves both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* exports address book data JSON or CSV files.
* imports address book data from JSON or CSV files.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation

This section describes noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Telegram

#### Implementation

The telegram handle field is facilitated by the `Telegram` class.
It is stored internally as a `String` in the data file `addressbook.json`
and is then initialized as a `Telegram` object. 

The `Telegram` class implements the following operation:

* `Telegram#isValidTelegram(String test)` — Returns true if a given
string is a valid telegram handle with the help of a validation regex.

Regex used in verifying the validity of telegram handle:

`public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = "\\w{5,32}";`
* `\w` — **Word**. Any word character (alphanumeric & underscore)
* `{5,32}` — **Quantifier**. Match between 5 and 32 of the preceding token.

#### Design considerations

The `Telegram` class is first integrated into the `Person` class and added as
a new field to the `Person` class. This is illustrated by the class diagram below,
where every field, including the `Telegram` field, is compulsory except the `Tag` field.

![PersonWithTelegramClassDiagram](images/PersonWithTelegramClassDiagram.png)

### Optional Fields

#### Implementation

The `Phone`, `Email` and `Address` fields are modified such that these fields are
no longer compulsory. The class diagram below illustrates the `Person` class after
the addition of the `Telegram` field. The `Name` and `Telegram` fields are compulsory
while the rest are optional.

![PersonOptionalFieldClassDiagram](images/PersonOptionalFieldClassDiagram.png)

In order to accomodate to the above mentioned new optional fields,
the respective constructors were modified such that the following examples
are considered valid inputs.

Example 1: Adding new contact without email and address.

```
add n/John Doe te/@johndoe123 p/98765432 
```

Example 2: Adding new contact without phone, email and address.

```
add n/John Doe te/@johndoe123
```

A more interesting input would be as such.

Example 3: Adding new contact without email and address but with empty phone input.

```
add n/John Doe te/@johndoe123 p/
```

In such a case, the constructors are modified such that the above input is also deemed
as valid. The rationale behind this is that there is nothing for the `VALIDATION_REGEX`
to verify, unlike in the following example.

Example 4: Adding new contact without email and address but with invalid phone input.

```
add n/John Doe te/@johndoe123 p/invalidPhoneNumber
```

For the case above, the respective constructors will carry out validation on the given input.

#### Design considerations

In order to allow for optional fields, the `AddCommandParser` also has to be modified.
In particular, the following methods are modified
* `AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent(argumentMultimap, prefixes)` — 
Returns true if none of the prefixes contains empty `Optional` values in the
given `ArgumentMultimap`.
* `AddCommandParser#parse(args)` — Parses the given `String` of arguments
in the context of the `AddCommand` and returns an `AddCommand` object for execution.
Throws `ParseException` if the user input does not conform the expected format.

For the `arePrefixesPresent` method, the prefixes provided were changed to only
include the following mandatory fields:
* `PREFIX_NAME`
* `PREFIX_TELEGRAM`
* `PREFIX_GITHUB`

`AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent(argumentMultimap, prefixes)` uses the static
parsing methods in `ParserUtil` to parse the different fields in `Person`.
The individual fields are first initialised with an empty string, which is now
a valid input. The method then calls the `arePrefixesPresent` method to check if
the provided prefix is present. If present, the method will then call the respective
static parsing methods in `ParserUtil`.

### GitHub

#### Implementation

The GitHub field is facilitated by the `Github` class. It is stored internally
as a `String` in the data file `addressbook.json` and is then initialized as a
`Github` object. 

The `Github` class implements the following operation:

* `Github#isValidGithub(String test)` — Returns true if a given string is
a valid GitHub username with the help of a validation regex.

Regex used in verifying the validity of GitHub username:

`public static final String VALIDATION_REGEX = "[a-zA-Z\d](?:[a-zA-Z\d]|-(?=[a-zA-Z\d])){0,38}";`
* `[a-zA-Z\d]` — **Character set**. Match any character in the set.
* `a-z` — **Range**. Matches a character in the range "a" to "z"
(char code 97 to 122). Case sensitive.
* `A-Z` — **Range**. Matches a character in the range "A" to "Z"
(char code 65 to 90). Case sensitive.
* `\d` — **Digit**. Matches any digit character (0-9).
* `(?:[a-zA-Z\d]|-(?=[a-zA-Z\d]))` — **Non-capturing group**.
Groups multiple tokens together without creating a capture group.
* `|` — **Alternation**. Acts like a boolean OR.
Matches the expression before or after the sign.
* `-` — **Character**. Matches a "-" character (char code 45).
* `{0,38}` — **Quantifier**. Match between 0 and 38 of the preceding token.

#### Design considerations

The `Github` class is first integrated into the `Person` class and added as
a new field to the `Person` class. This is illustrated by the class diagram below,
where only the `Name`, `Telegram` and `Github` fields are compulsory.

![PersonWithGithubClassDiagram](images/PersonWithGithubClassDiagram.png)

### Favorite command

#### Implementation

The Favorite command favorites a non-favorited contact from the current list of contacts.

In order to distinguish whether a contact has been favorited or unfavorited,
a boolean flag, an `isFavorite` field is added into the `Person` class and
is initialised as `false` when adding new contacts to the address book.

The following methods are added to `Person` to help identify and toggle the `isFavorite`
field within a `Person` object:
* `Person#isFavorite()` — Returns a boolean flag to tell whether the `Person`
object is Favorited or not.
* `Person#SetIsFavorite()` — Sets the `Person` objects' `isFavorite` field to
`true`, which basically favorites the contact of this `Person` object.
* `Person#SetNotIsFavorite()` — Sets the `Person` objects' `isFavorite` field to
`false`, which basically unfavorites the contact of this `Person` object.

Favoriting contacts is facilitated by the `IsFavoritePredicate`.
* `IsFavoritePredicate` stores a boolean flag for comparison with a `Person` object.
* It also has a `IsFavoritePredicate#test(Person person)` to determine if the `Person`
input into the test is currently favorited or unfavorited.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `FavoriteCommand` is executed:
* **Step 1:** The user enters favorite command keyword followed by the index
of the contact to be favorited `fav 1`.
* **Step 2:** The `LogicManager` executes the input command text calling the method
`LogicManager#execute(String commandText)`.
* **Step 3:** The `LogicManager#execute(String commandText)` method calls the following
method from `AddressBookParser`, `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String userInput)`.
* **Step 4:** Since the command input is a command with description, the command
word `fav` and argument `1` is passed into
`AddressBookParser#parseCommandWithDescription(String commandWord, String arguments)`
which creates a new `FavoriteCommandParser`.
* **Step 5:** `FavoriteCommandParser#parse(String args)` is then called.
Since the argument provided here, `1`, is a valid argument for the favorite command,
a `FavoriteCommand(1)` is returned.
* **Step 6:** The `FavoriteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is then finally called,
favoriting the contact at index `1` through the `model` provided as input argument by
calling `ModelManager#favoritePerson(Person target)`.

The Sequence Diagrams below illustrates how the components interact with each other
for the scenario where the user issues the command `fav 1`.

![FavoriteSequenceDiagram](images/FavoriteSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to keep track of isFavorite**

* **Alternative 1 (Current Implementation):** Create a boolean flag within `Person` class
which signifies that a `Person` is favorite if `true` and vice versa.
    * Pros: Can be easily toggled since the execute method takes in model as arguments.
    `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` retrieves the list of `Person`.
    The status of the boolean flag can be easily identified by `Person#isFavorite()`
    and easily toggled by `Person#SetIsFavorite()` or `Person#SetNotIsFavorite()`.
    * Cons: Increased coupling. The toggling of `isFavorite` should ideally be handled
    by another class, similar to the other fields in `Person` such as `Github` and `Telegram`.
    
* **Alternative 2:** Create a `Favorite` class which stores a boolean flag which signifies
that a `Person` is favorite if `true` and vice versa.
    * Pros: Reduced coupling. The toggling of `isFavorite` will no longer have to be handled
    by the `Person` class. This is similar to that of other fields such as `Github` and
    `Telegram` where the contents of the respective fields are handled by their
    respective classes.
    * Cons: Does not make sense to create a new class to store a single boolean value.
    Unlike other fields which will require validation with the help of a validation regex,
    `isFavorite` can only hold either a `true` or `false` value. There is absolutely
    no need to validate the validity of the boolean values, much less create a validation
    regex.

### Unfavorite command

#### Implementation

The Unfavorite command unfavorites a favorited contact from the current list of contacts.

Similar to Favorite command, in order to distinguish whether a contact has
been favorited or unfavorited, a boolean flag, an `isFavorite` field is added
into the `Person` class and is initialised as `false` when adding new contacts
to the address book.

The following methods are added to `Person` to help identify and toggle the `isFavorite`
field within a `Person` object:
* `Person#isFavorite()` — Returns a boolean flag to tell whether the `Person`
object is Favorited or not.
* `Person#SetIsFavorite()` — Sets the `Person` objects' `isFavorite` field to
`true`, which basically favorites the contact of this `Person` object.
* `Person#SetNotIsFavorite()` — Sets the `Person` objects' `isFavorite` field to
`false`, which basically unfavorites the contact of this `Person` object.

Similar to Favoriting contacts, Unfavoriting contacts is also facilitated by the
`IsFavoritePredicate`.
* `IsFavoritePredicate` stores a boolean flag for comparison with a `Person` object.
* It also has a `IsFavoritePredicate#test(Person person)` to determine if the `Person`
input into the test is currently favorited or unfavorited.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `UnfavoriteCommand` is executed:
* **Step 1:** The user enters unfavorite command keyword followed by the index
of the contact to be unfavorited `unfav 1`.
* **Step 2:** The `LogicManager` executes the input command text calling the method
`LogicManager#execute(String commandText)`.
* **Step 3:** The `LogicManager#execute(String commandText)` method calls the following
method from `AddressBookParser`, `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String userInput)`.
* **Step 4:** Since the command input is a command with description, the command
word `unfav` and argument `1` is passed into
`AddressBookParser#parseCommandWithDescription(String commandWord, String arguments)`
which creates a new `UnfavoriteCommandParser`.
* **Step 5:** `UnfavoriteCommandParser#parse(String args)` is then called.
Since the argument provided here, `1`, is a valid argument for the unfavorite command,
a `UnfavoriteCommand(1)` is returned.
* **Step 6:** The `UnfavoriteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is then finally called,
unfavoriting the contact at index `1` through the `model` provided as input argument by
calling `ModelManager#unfavoritePerson(Person target)`.

The Sequence Diagrams below illustrates how the components interact with each other
for the scenario where the user issues the command `unfav 1`.

![UnfavoriteSequenceDiagram](images/UnfavoriteSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to keep track of isFavorite**

* **Alternative 1 (Current Implementation):** Create a boolean flag within `Person` class
which signifies that a `Person` is favorite if `true` and vice versa.
    * Pros: Can be easily toggled since the execute method takes in model as arguments.
    `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` retrieves the list of `Person`.
    The status of the boolean flag can be easily identified by `Person#isFavorite()`
    and easily toggled by `Person#SetIsFavorite()` or `Person#SetNotIsFavorite()`.
    * Cons: Increased coupling. The toggling of `isFavorite` should ideally be handled
    by another class, similar to the other fields in `Person` such as `Github` and `Telegram`.
    
* **Alternative 2:** Create a `Favorite` class which stores a boolean flag which signifies
that a `Person` is favorite if `true` and vice versa.
    * Pros: Reduced coupling. The toggling of `isFavorite` will no longer have to be handled
    by the `Person` class. This is similar to that of other fields such as `Github` and
    `Telegram` where the contents of the respective fields are handled by their
    respective classes.
    * Cons: Does not make sense to create a new class to store a single boolean value.
    Unlike other fields which will require validation with the help of a validation regex,
    `isFavorite` can only hold either a `true` or `false` value. There is absolutely
    no need to validate the validity of the boolean values, much less create a validation
    regex.

### Export command

#### Implementation

The Export command exports the current list of contacts to the specified JSON or CSV file, with help from [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), an external library. It does not overwrite existing files.

Executing an Export Command can be summarized with the following steps:
1. User command is handed over to `ExportCommandParser`. After verification of arguments, an ExportCommand is generated.
2. Upon executing the `ExportCommand`, one of the 2 methods are called, depending on the file type specified.
   * `ImportCommand#exportAddressBookToJson(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`
   * `ImportCommand#exportAddressBookToCsv(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`

Firstly, the user command is handed over to `ExportCommandParser`. `ExportCommandParser` implements `Parser<ExportCommand>`. It implements the `parse()` method, which parses the user's command and returns an `ExportCommand` with the filename. In `parse()`, it verifies 3 requirements:
* Arguments are not empty
* Not more than 1 argument
* Filename provided is a .csv or .json file

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component during the first step of executing `execute("export cs2103t.json")`.

![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ExportSequenceDiagramStep1.png)

Next, The `ExportCommand` is then executed in `LogicManager`. The `ExportCommand` class extends `Command`. It stores the filename as a class variable and its implementation of `Command#execute()`. Here, the filename is checked again to verify that it is a .csv or .json file. The current address book is obtained by `Model#getAddressBook()`. Then, depending on the file type, one of the following methods are called:

1. `exportAddressBookToJson(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`

   A temporary instance of `JsonAddressBookStorage` is created by passing in the filename, and `saveAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)` saves the current address book to the specified file.
    ```
   temporaryStorage.saveAddressBook(currentAddressBook, filePath, true);
   ```
   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
    :information_source: **Note:** The third argument `true` indicates that `saveAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)` is triggered by an export command. This distinction is necessary as default saving of contact data to the address book is performed with the same method, but requires overwriting of the storage file, whereas the export command does not overwrite files.
    </div>

   In the Storage component, utility classes are used to check, create and write to the JSON file.
    1. `FileUtil#isFileExists(Path)` checks if there exists a file with the specified name. If there is, a `FileAlreadyExistsException` is thrown.
    2. `FileUtil#createIfMissing(Path)` creates the JSON file.
    3. The current `ReadOnlyAddressBook` is used to instantiate a new `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, a JSON-friendly equivalent of `ReadOnlyAddressBook` containing Jackson annotations. It stores a list of `JsonAdaptedPerson` instead of `Person`, which is also JSON-friendly.
    4. `JsonUtil#saveJsonFile(T, Path)` serializes the address book and writes to the file, using `ObjectMapper`, a Jackson class.

2. `exportAddressBookToCsv(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`

   A temporary instance of `CsvAddressBookStorage` is created by passing in the filename, and `saveAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)` saves the current address book to the specified file.
    ```
   temporaryStorage.saveAddressBook(currentAddressBook, filePath);
   ```
   In the Storage component, utility classes are used to check, create and write to the JSON file.
    1. `FileUtil#isFileExists(Path)` checks if there exists a file with the specified name. If there is, a `FileAlreadyExistsException` is thrown.
    2. `FileUtil#createIfMissing(Path)` creates the CSV file.
    3. The current `ReadOnlyAddressBook` is used to instantiate a new `CsvSerializableAddressBook`, a CSV-friendly equivalent of `ReadOnlyAddressBook` containing Jackson annotations. It stores a list of `CsvAdaptedPerson` instead of `Person`, which is also CSV-friendly.
    4. `CsvUtil#saveCsvFile(T, Path)` serializes the address book and writes to the file, using `CsvMapper`, a Jackson class.


The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions during the second step of executing `execute("export cs2103t.json")`.

![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ExportSequenceDiagramStep2.png)

### Import command

The Import command imports contacts from a JSON or CSV file and adds them to the current contact list, with help from [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), an external library. Import does not remove existing contacts, and ignores duplicate contacts.

Executing an Import command can be summarized with the following steps:
1. Similar to Export, the first step is parsing the user command, which is done in `ImportCommandParser`. After verification, an `ImportCommand` is generated.
2. Upon executing the `ImportCommand`, one of the 2 methods are called to obtain a `List<Person>` from the specified file.
   * `ImportCommand#getImportedPersonsFromJson()`
   * `ImportCommand#getImportedPersonsFromCsv()`
3. By iterating through the list, each person is added to the current contact list in `Model`, skipping duplicates.
4. Command Result with success message is returned.

The sequence diagram for the first step is similar to the Export Command. The following sequence diagram illustrates the execution of an import command from part 2 onwards.

![ImportSequenceDiagram](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Reading JSON / CSV file

In both scenarios, a new `JsonAddressBookStorage` or `CsvAddressBookStorage` is created. The `AddressBookStorage` method `readAddressBook()` then reads the respective file using `JsonUtil#readJsonFile()` or `CsvUtil#readCsvFile()`. In both cases, the files are read using Jackson's `ObjectMapper` or `CsvMapper` classes respectively.


### Edit Profile command

#### Implementation

Edits the user's profile linked to the Address Book.

The user's profile contains details such as their name, Telegram Handle and GitHub username, which need to be kept up to date.
This is especially important as the user's GitHub username is crucial for the Find a Buddy feature which matches them
with a potential teammate using the GitHub metadata.

The edit profile feature allows edit to change their name, Telegram handle and GitHub username.

The implementation for editing the user profile is similar to that of editing a student contact. 
It is facilitated by the `EditCommandParser` class, which implements `Parser<EditCommand>`.
It implements the `parse()` method, which determines whether what's being edited is a contact or the user profile, checks for 
the validity of user input (through the `checkEditProfileInputFormat()` method) and returns an `EditCommand`, to be executed in
`LogicManager`.

The `EditCommand` class extends `Command`. Its instance is created by providing an `index` (since a contact isn't being edited here, 
the index passed is 1 by default and will not affect the process), and an `editPersonDescriptor` (which represents the updated user profile).
Its implementation of `Command#execute()` calls the `executeEditProfile()` method which edits the user profile as necessary.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components for
the `execute("edit profile te/john_doe g/john-codes")` API call.

### Find command

#### Implementation

The Find command accepts names, tags, Telegram handles or GitHub usernames as parameters with the following prefixes :
* no prefix : for names
* `t/` : for tags
* `te/` : for Telegram handles
* `g/` : for GitHub usernames

and allows users to search for contacts based on the specified criterion.
It is facilitated by the `FindCommandParser` class, which implements `Parser<FindCommand>`.
It implements the `parse()` method, which parses the find parameter (eg: name, tag, etc.) and returns a `FindCommand`, to be executed in
`LogicManager`.

The `FindCommand` class extends `Command`. Its instance is created by providing a predicate (condition to be fulfilled by the elements of 
the `FilteredPersonList` that contains the contact(s) matching the find parameters). Its implementation of
`Command#execute()` updates the `FilteredPersonList` to reflect the search performed on the contacts in the address book.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components for
the `execute("find Bob Joe")` API call.

![FindGithubSequenceDiagram](images/FindGithubSequenceDiagram.png)

### Tag command

#### Implementation

The Tag command allows users to directly add or remove tags from a specific contact. This command was introduced to 
overcome the following limitations:
1. Editing a contact's tag field using `edit <INDEX> t/<TAG>` will replace the existing tag with the specified one 
instead of adding on to it.
2. No way to remove tags from a contact directly.

It is facilitated by the `TagCommandParser` class, which implements `Parser<TagCommand>`.
It implements the `parse()` method, which parses the index of the contact to which tags are to be added or from which 
tags are to be removed. Moreover, checking the validity of the user input (i.e. ensuring the presence of arguments for the `Tag` command like tags to add where the prefix `a/` is present and the
presence of tags to remove where the prefix `r/` is present) is handled by the `checkInputFormat` method. Once the input is confirmed to be valid, `parse()` returns a `TagCommand`, to be executed in
`LogicManager`. 

The `TagCommand` class extends `Command`. Its instance is created by providing the `targetIndex` of the contact to which 
tags are to be added or from which tags are to be removed (of type `Index`), an ArrayList containing the tags to be 
added (`toAdd`) and an ArrayList containing the tags to be removed (`toRemove`). Its implementation of `Command#execute()` is where the updation of the `FilteredPersonList` to reflect the search performed on the contacts in the address book.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components for
the `execute("tag 1 a/friends")` API call.

### Welcome Window

#### Implementation

The class `WelcomeWindow` is responsible for displaying the welcome window at 
the start when the application is launched. It is facilitated by the 
`WelcomeWindow.fxml` and `WelcomeWindow.css`.  The `.fxml` file is responsible 
for the layout of the various components in this window, and the `.css` file 
adds a style and enhances the overall UI.

The `WelcomeWindow` class extends `UiPart<Stage>`.

When the app is launched, an instance of this class is created, and the
`WelcomeWindow#start()` is invoked to display the window. Various methods, including 
`fadeTransition()` and `displayAnimatedText(String textToDisplay, double delayTime)`
, are used within this class to achieve the fading image and character typing 
effect, respectively.

![WelcomeWindowSequenceDiagram](images/WelcomeWindowSequenceDiagram.png)

### Profile SetUp Window

#### Implementation

The class `ProfileSetUpWindow` is responsible for displaying the Profile SetUp Window. 
It is only shown once when the User launches the app for the first time, and their 
credentials are not present. They have to input their valid credentials here.
It is facilitated by `ProfileSetUpWindow.fxml` and 
`ProfileSetUpWindow.css`. The `.fxml` file is responsible for the layout of the 
various components in this window, and the `.css` file adds a style and enhances 
the overall UI.

The `ProfileSetUpWindow` class extends `UiPart<Stage>`.

This window would only be visible after the Welcome Window Splash Screen. 
`WelcomeWindow` hands over the control to `MainWindow` after execution, which 
then sets up the `ProfileSetUpWindow`. On Initializing and calling `start()` 
method of the `ProfileSetUpWindow`, the `ProfileSetUpWindow` with the help of 
a `Logic` object (which is obtained during initialization) checks, if a 
User Profile is present. If it is present, it 
again hands over the control to the `MainWindow` by calling the `start()` method 
of the `MainWindow`. Else, It displays the Profile SetUp Window and 
waits for a response from the User.

After the User has input their credentials in the text fields, they are expected to 
click the `Submit` button. When that button is clicked upon, the `submit()` method is 
invoked. This method calls the `areUserCredentialsValid()` method to verify if the
entered credentials are valid or not. If they are valid, the User Profile is deemed 
complete and is set up with the help of the `Logic` object obtained during
the initialization. If the credentials are not valid, an error message
is shown in the Window, highlighting which credential is invalid. The User cannot proceed
forward without entering all valid Credentials.

The `areUserCredentialsValid()` class checks if the entered Name, Telegram Handle,
and the GitHub Username are valid. 

1. Class level method `isValidName()`, of `Name` class 
   verifies the Name entered.
2. Class level method `isValidTelegram()`, of `Telegram` class
   verifies the Telegram Handle entered.
3. Class level method `isValidGithub()`, of `Github` class
   verifies the GitHub Username entered.

If either of the credentials is not valid, the `setErrorMessageText(MESSAGE)` is
called with the appropriate error message. This method is responsible for displaying 
this error message in the Window.

### User Profile Window

#### Implementation

The class `UserProfileWindow` is responsible for displaying the User Profile
Window. It is shown when the user either uses the keyboard shortcut, 
`Command/Control + P`, or clicks on the User Profile located in the top right in
the Menu Bar. It is facilitated by `UserProfileWindow.fxml`
and `UserProfileWindow.css`. The `.fxml` file is responsible for the layout of the
various components in this window, and the `.css` file adds a style and enhances the
overall UI.

The `UserProfileWindow` class extends `UiPart<Stage>`.

This window can only be viewed when the app has successfully started up and 
has valid User Credentials.

This window is initialized when the `MainWindow` is initialized. It is
initialized in the `MainWindow` constructor. This window, to be seen, has to be 
triggered as an event by the user. The `MainWindow` class has a method 
`handleUserProfileWindow()`, which is responsible for displaying this window.

The `handleUserProfileWindow()` when called, calls the method `isShowing()` via 
the object initialized earlier. If it is not showing, the `show()` method of the
`UserProfileWindow` class is called upon. Else, if it is already showing, the
`focus()` method is called upon. Along with that, in case the window had been
minimized by the User, `UserProfileWindow#getRoot()#toFront()` is called to
bring the window to the maximized state.

The `UserProfileWindow#show()`, first calls the `UserProfileWindow#initializeFields()`,
to initialize all the fields with the latest User Profile Credentials. This would, in turn
also call `UserProfileWindow#setFields()`, to set them up in the UI. After all the setting
up is done, the User Profile Window is shown.

The `UserProfileWindow#focus()`, calls the `getRoot()` method and on that `requestFocus()` 
is called upon to request focus.

![UserProfileWindowSequenceDiagram](images/UserProfileWindowSequenceDiagram.png)

### Help Window

#### Implementation

The class `HelpWindow` is responsible for displaying the Help
Window. It is shown when the user either uses the keyboard shortcut,
`F1`, or clicks on `Help` located on the top left in the Menu Bar, or types 
in `help` in the command box. It is facilitated by `HelpWindow.fxml`
and `HelpWindow.css`. The `.fxml` file is responsible for the layout of the
various components in this window, and the `.css` file adds a style and enhances the
overall UI.

The `HelpWindow` class extends `UiPart<Stage>`.

This window can only be viewed when the app has successfully started up and 
has valid User Credentials.

This window is initialized when the `MainWindow` is initialized. It is
initialized in the `MainWindow` constructor. This window, to be seen, has to be
triggered as an event by the user. The `MainWindow` class has a method
`handleHelpWindow()`, which is responsible for displaying this window.

On initializing the `HelpWindow` class, `HelpWindow#setUpCommandDetails()` and
`HelpWindow#setUpHelpTableView()` are called.

`setUpCommandDetails()` creates multiple objects of `CommandDetails`, all of them
representing a unique command that the app supports. Those are then added to an
`ObservableList<CommandDetails>`, which is linked to the `TableView` in the UI.

`setUpHelpTableView()` sets and places various restrictions on the table.
It restricts any events or scrolling on the table. Also, It adjusts the height
of the table according to the number of `CommandDetails` present in it.

The `handleHelpWindow()` when called, calls the method `isShowing()` via
the object initialized earlier. If it is not showing, the `show()` method of the
`HelpWindow` class is called upon. Else, if it is already showing, the
`focus()` method is called upon. Along with that, in case the window had been
minimized by the User, `HelpWindow#getRoot()#toFront()` is called to
bring the window to the maximized state.

There is also a button present in the window, `Visit URL`, which upon 
clicking, takes the User to the UserGuide. It opens the UserGuide in the
Users systems default browser.

![HelpWindowVisitURLButton](images/HelpWindowVisitURLButton.png)

![HelpWindowSequenceDiagram](images/HelpWindowSequenceDiagram.png)

### User Profile in Menu Bar

#### Implementation

The class `UserProfileInMenuBar` is responsible for displaying the User
Profile in the Menu Bar. It is shown in the Main Window, in the top right
of the Menu Bar beside the Bell icon. It is facilitated by `UserProfileInMenuBar.fxml`.
The `.fxml` file is responsible for the layout of the various components inside
this Region. On clicking this, the `UserProfileWindow` is shown.

![UserProfileInMenuBarPictureHighlight](images/UserProfileInMenuBarPictureHighlight.png)

The `UserProfileInMenuBar` class extends `UiPart<Region>` and implements
`UserProfileWatcher`.

This Region can only be viewed when the app has successfully started up and
has valid User Credentials.

This Region is initialized when the `MainWindow#start()` is called. On 
initializing the `UserProfileInMenuBar` class, `UserProfileInMenuBar#setUserProfileOnMenuBar()` 
and `UserProfileInMenuBar#addToUserProfileWatcherList()` are called.

`setUserProfileOnMenuBar()` is responsible for retrieving the User Credentials with
the help of the `Logic` object obtained during initialization and setting up the 
`ImageView` and `Label` with the User Credentials retrieved.

`addToUserProfileWatcherList()` is responsible for adding `this` (UserProfileWatcher)
to a watchers list, such that, in the scenario, the User updates their profile
credentials, the changes are reflected immediately. As the User is able to 
edit their Credentials via the `EditCommand`, the profile watchers list is present there.
A static method in `EditCommand`, `addUserProfileWatcher(this)` is called upon, by
passing `this` (UserProfileWatcher) as an argument, to add it to the profile watchers list.

Whenever there is a change in the User Credentials, the `updateUserProfile()` is
called upon in the `UserProfileInMenuBar`, which in turn calls the 
`setUserProfileOnMenuBar()`. This method then retrieves the new User Credentials
and sets them up.

![UserProfileInMenuBarSequenceDiagram](images/UserProfileInMenuBarSequenceDiagram.png)

### Show command

#### Implementation

The Show command accepts the index in list or name of a contact as a parameter, and shows all the details of the contact to the
Person Details Pane on the right-hand side of the screen. It is facilitated by the `ShowCommandParser` class, which implements `Parser<ShowCommand>`.
It implements the `parse()` method, which parses the index/name and returns a `ShowCommand`, to be executed in
`LogicManager`.

The `ShowCommand` class extends `Command`. It stores the index/name as a class variable and its implementation of
`Command#execute()` calls `Command#executeWithIndex()` or `Command#executeWithName()` based on whether parameter is index or name.

#### Implementation of `Command#executeWithIndex()`

This is called if the parameter is a parsable Integer. 
The method calls `model.setSelectedIndex(index)` which displays the details of the contact on the Details Pane.



The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic`, `Model` and `UI` components for
the `execute("show 5")` API call.

![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ShowWithIndexSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Implementation of `Command#executeWithName()`

This is called if the parameter is **NOT** a parsable Integer.
The method calls `model.setSelectedIndex(index)` with index gotten from the `filteredList` which displays the details of the contact on the Details Pane.
If there are multiple contacts with names that contain the parameter keyword then a list of such persons are shown.
If there is no contact with name that contain the parameter keyword in the `filteredList`, then the entire address book is searched.


The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic`, `Model` and `UI` components for
the `execute("show alex")` API call.

![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ShowWithNameSequenceDiagram.png)

### Command History (Keyboard Shortcut)

In the Command Box, users can use up and down arrow keys to navigate through previous commands, similar to the Command Line. This is achieved by interactions between `CommandHistory` and `CommandBox`.

The `CommandHistory` class contains these key variables and methods:
* An `ArrayList<String>` which stores previous user commands
* An `int` which indicates the current index
* Methods `add(String)`, `getPrevious()`, `getNext()`, `resetIndex()`

When CohortConnect UI is initialized, the `CommandBox` class representing the Command Box is created, containing a single instance of `CommandHistory`. It interacts with `CommandHistory` in 3 ways:
1. If `KeyCode.UP` is detected in the `TextField`, `CommandHistory#getPrevious()` is called, and the returned String is set to the text field.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
    :information_source: **Note:** If the history is empty, UP will return an empty string. If the current index is at the earliest command, it will continue to return the same command. 
    </div>

    The activity diagram below illustrates what happens when a user presses the UP arrow key.

    ![CommandHistoryActivityDiagramUp](images/CommandHistoryActivityDiagramUp.png)

2. If `KeyCode.DOWN` is detected in the `TextField`, `CommandHistory#getNext()` is called, and the returned String is set to the text field.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
    :information_source: **Note:** If the history is empty or the current index is at the latest command, DOWN will return an empty string.   
    </div>

    The activity diagram below illustrates what happens when a user presses the DOWN arrow key.

    ![CommandHistoryActivityDiagramDown](images/CommandHistoryActivityDiagramDown.png)

3. When the user presses enter to execute a command, the command is saved using `CommandHistory#add(String)`, and the current index is reset using `CommandHistory#resetIndex()`.

### Switching Between Tabs (Keyboard Shortcut)

![WindowMenu](images/WindowMenu.png)

**Accelerators** are shortcuts to Menu Items, which can be associated with `KeyCombinations`. To switch between the 4 tabs, a new Menu Window was added in the MenuBar, containing 4 Menu Items which can be accessed using Cmd/Ctrl + 1/2/3/4. Each of the Menu Items have an `onAction` method declared in their FXML files, and defined in `MainWindow.java`.

1. Accelerators for the 4 Menu Items are set during initialization of `MainWindow.java`.

    ```
    private void setAccelerators() {
        setAccelerator(contacts, KeyCombination.valueOf("Shortcut+1"));
        setAccelerator(favorites, KeyCombination.valueOf("Shortcut+2"));
        setAccelerator(events, KeyCombination.valueOf("Shortcut+3"));
        setAccelerator(findABuddy, KeyCombination.valueOf("Shortcut+4"));
        ...
    }
    ```

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
    :information_source: **Note:** When detecting KeyCombination, Javafx automatically switches its interpretation of "Shortcut" as "Ctrl" for Windows and "Cmd" for macOS. The symbols in the MenuItem (shown above) change as well.
    </div>

2. When their respective key combinations are detected, the MenuItem's onAction methods are called. For example, the following method is called when Cmd/Ctrl + 4 is detected.

    ```
    @FXML
    public void handleFindABuddy() {
        tabPaneHeader.activateFindABuddy(logic);
    }
    ```

3. `TabPaneHeader` then switches to the Find A Buddy tab using `tabPane.getSelectionModel().select(3)`.


### GitHub and Telegram Commands

In the Command Box, users can enter `g` or `te` to open the currently selected user's GitHub or Telegram in a browser, using their respective username.

The following links are used
- GitHub: `https://github.com/{username}`
- Telegram: `https://t.me/{username}`

Similar to other commands, the commands `g` and `te` are parsed in `AddressBookParser`, where it is checked that there are no other arguments.

During their execution, it is checked that there is a current user selected, using `Model#getSelectedIndex()`. If the returned value is `-1`, then a `CommandException` is thrown.

The CommandResult returned indicates whether it is triggered by a GitHub or Telegram command using booleans variables.

In `MainWindow`, if the command result `isGithub()` or `isTelegram()`, the GitHub and Telegram links in `PersonDetails` will be triggered using `PersonDetails#openTelegram()` and `PersonDetails#openGithub()`. 

### Find A Buddy Feature

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/docs/images/Find%20A%20Buddy.png?raw=true">
</p>

By switching to the Find A Buddy tab, the user can retrieve the top 5 matches to the user based on the GitHub data gathered.

#### Implementation

For the feature, the data gathered includes
- Number of Repositories
- Percentage of Contributions by Language

A similarity score is calculated based on the following three metrics:

- Euclidean Distance
<p align="left">
  <img width="400" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9pSSh4QM7whgtJUD6X2vsQ.png">
</p>

- Manhattan Distance
<p align="left">
  <img width="400" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SU-KZ_Ui8FVbQ7ZKjkiQZg.png">
</p>

- Cosine Distance
<p align="left">
  <img width="400" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1174/1*gDCDATwjt2hAjd72O8HvbA.png">
</p>


The similarity is calculated using the following formula:

`Similarity Score = 1 - Normalize((Euclidean Distance + Manhattan Distance + Cosine Distance) / 3.0)`
