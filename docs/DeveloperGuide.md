## **Introduction**

Managera is a desktop application provides event organisers with a convenient method of keeping track of upcoming
events and the details of their participants. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a 
CLI (Command Line Interface).

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Managera Product Website](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t10-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)**.

### Architecture

<img src="images/DG-images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues 
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/DG-images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API 
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using 
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component 
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the 
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/DG-images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/DG-images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ParticipantListPanel`, 
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures 
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files 
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in 
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Participant` or `Event` objects residing in the 
  `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/DG-images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is 
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` 
API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DG-images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/DG-images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a 
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to 
  parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns 
  back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` 
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/DG-images/ModelClassDiagram.png)


The `Model` component,

* stores Managera's data i.e., all `Participant` and `Event` objects (which are contained in `UniqueParticipantList` 
  and `UniqueEventList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Participant` and `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as 
  separate _filtered_ lists which is exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Participant>` and 
  `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically 
  updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a 
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they 
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/DG-images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both Managera data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only 
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects 
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. The features covered in this 
guide are:

* [Add event feature - addEvent](#add-event-feature---addevent)
* [Delete event feature - deleteEvent](#delete-event-feature---deleteevent)
* [Filter event feature - filterEvents](#filter-event-feature---filterevents)
* [View participant's details feature - view](#view-participants-details-feature---view)
* [Add/Remove participant to/from event feature - enroll/expel](#addremove-participant-tofrom-event-feature---enrollexpel)
* [View event's details feature - showDetails](#view-events-details-feature---showdetails)

The end of this section also includes suggestions on how newly proposed features can be implemented.

### Add event feature - addEvent

This feature allows Managera users to create an event at the specified date and time.

#### Implementation Details

Since the `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input,
we can simply add a new `commandType` case for `AddEventCommand` in `AddressBookParser`. 

The `AddEventCommandParser` reads the user's input and passes it to `ParserUtil` to ensure that the event's name, 
date and time are valid. Then, an `Event` is created with the returned `EventName`, `EventDate` and `EventTime` objects. 
This event will be supplied to the `AddEventCommand` to be executed.

Since Managera employs a UniqueEventList, it should not have more than one event with the same name and date. The 
`AddressBook` will check if the given event already exists. If not, it will be successfully added to the `AddressBook` 
through the model. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown, and an error message will be displayed to the user.

#### Implementation Rationale

As events may span a full day, we decided to implement time as an optional attribute of the event. If a time is not 
specified for an event, Managera will assume it as a full-day event. To accommodate the addition of events to Managera, 
new classes such as `EventName`, `EventDate` and `EventTime` were also implemented. These classes function as abstractions 
for the name, date and time of an `Event` respectively. These abstractions are helpful in ensuring reliability of 
the program by hiding the underlying details.

### Delete event feature - deleteEvent

This feature allows Managera users to delete an existing event at a particular index of the displayed event list.

#### Implementation Details

Since the `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input,
we can simply add a new `commandType` case for `DeleteEventCommand` in `AddressBookParser`.

The `DeleteEventCommandParser` reads the user's input and passes it to `ParserUtil` which returns an `Index`.
If the index given by the user is not a zero-based index, a `ParseException` will be thrown before
the parser creates the command to prevent any further error. If the index is valid, a `DeleteEventCommand` 
will be created by the parser with the created `Index`.

When the command is executed, there is a check to ensure the index is within the range of the displayed list. If the 
index is out of range, a `CommandException` is thrown, and an error message is displayed to the user. Otherwise, the 
execution will continue, and the respective event at the index is deleted.

#### Design Considerations:
##### Aspect: Specifying event to be deleted: 

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Delete by index:
    * Pros:
        1. The index of the event in the currently displayed list can be directly used.
        2. Faster and more intuitive for users.
    * Cons:
        1. The index is independent of the event, which may lead to an inconsistent user experience.
         
* **Alternative 2**: Delete by event name:
    * Pros:
        1. User can be more sure of the event they are removing, since it is referencing the event name.
    * Cons:
        1. The user has to fully match the event name, which is much more cumbersome.

### Filter event feature - filterEvents

This feature allows Managera users to filter the event list by date and time. Only the events that fall on the 
specified date and time will be left in the filtered list.

#### Implementation Details

Since the `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from the user's input, 
we can simply add a new `commandType` case for `FilterEventCommand` in `AddressBookParser`. 

Since this feature requires Managera to take in user input and determine if the filter is by:

1. Date only, or
2. Date and Time,

a `FilterEventCommandParser` is made to be responsible for this purpose. The `FilterEventCommandParser` parses the 
user's input and creates the `EventDateTimePredicate` which the `FilterEventCommand` will use to execute the filtering.
`EventDateTimePredicate` implements `Predicate<Event>` which can be passed to a `FilteredList<Event>` to filter the 
event list. 

The `FilterEventCommand` created by `FilterEventCommandParser` will contain the `EventDateTimePredicate` to filter the 
event list. When the command is executed, the `model` will filter the `FilteredList<Event>` using the 
`EventDateTimePredicate` and display only events that fulfils the `EventDateTimePredicate` contained in 
`FilterEventCommand`.

#### Implementation Rationale

With considerations to how the `Event` class is implemented, some events do not have time associated with them.
We feel that since all `Event` objects have a date associated through the `EventDate` class, filtering should be done 
primarily through date i.e. `EventDate`. However, understanding that users might want to filter by time too, it is 
included as an 
optional criteria for filtering.

#### Design Considerations:
##### Aspect: Criteria to filter by:

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: By date and optionally time:
  * Pros: 
    1. Filtering by "date only" allows users to see both events with or without time on the specific date.
    2. Greater flexibility on how specific users want to filter the event list by.
  * Cons:
    1. Unable to filter for only events that do not have time associated.


* **Alternative 2**: By Date and Time: (both fields compulsory)
  * Pros:
    1. Able to filter for only events that do not have time on a specific date.
  * Cons:
    1. Unable to get a more general filter for events occurring on a specific date.
    2. Compulsory time field is too specific and the number of events displayed for a filter attempt might be too low. 

##### Aspect: With or without prefix:

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: With prefixes:
  * Pros:
    1. Sequence of parameters can be randomized, more flexible command syntax.
    2. Clear to user which field is being keyed in.
    3. Easy to implement with support of existing classes.
  * Cons:
    1. This increases the number of prefixes already present in Managera which may be hard for users to remember.


* **Alternative 2**: Without prefix:
  * Pros:
    1. Clean and slightly shorter command syntax.
    2. Less prefix to remember.
  * Cons:
    1. Rigid command syntax.
    2. Requires more comprehensive implementation to deal with user input (E.g. Date Only or Date and Time)

The following is the sequence diagram for how a `FilterEventCommand` works internally.

![FilterEventSequenceDiagram](images/DG-images/FilterEventSequenceDiagram.png)

### View participant's details feature - view

This feature allows Managera users to look for a specific participant and view their details. The search is done using
the participant's index in the displayed participant list.

#### Implementation Details

Since the `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input,
we can simply add a new `commandType` case for `ViewCommand` in `AddressBookParser`.

The `ViewCommandParser` reads the user's input and passes it to `ParserUtil` which returns an `Index`. If the index 
given by the user is not a zero-based index, a `ParseException` will be thrown before the parser creates the command 
to prevent any further error. If the index is valid, a `ViewCommand` will be created by the parser with the 
created `Index`.

When the command is executed, there is a check to ensure the index is within the range of the displayed list. If the
index is out of range, a `CommandException` is thrown, and an error message is displayed to the user. Otherwise, the
execution will continue, and `model` will obtain the participant by getting the `Participant` with the given `Index` 
from the `FilteredList<Participant>` before displaying the participant's details to the user.

#### Implementation Rationale

Since each participant has a unique index in the displayed participant list, it provides a convenient way for the user 
to look for a specific participant if index is used as the criterion. The `find` command provides similar functionality,
but returns a list of participants instead because it uses names, which are more imprecise. Hence, a separate command 
was decidedly implemented to allow users the ability to sieve out a single participant for a more detailed view.

#### Design Considerations:
##### Aspect: Method of finding a participant:

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Find by index:
    * Pros:
        1. The details of the specific participant are returned immediately, provided that the user's input is a valid 
           index in the displayed participant list.
        2. Simple implementation.
    * Cons:
        1. The user has to know the index of the participant, which can be troublesome with a long list of participants.
           However, the user can use the `find` function to filter their search, making this process slightly easier.

* **Alternative 2**: Find by participant's ID:
    * Pros:
        1. The details of the specific participant are returned immediately, provided that the user's input is an exact
           match of the participant's ID.
    * Cons:
        1. The current implementation does not provide the `ParticipantId` to the user, and providing more details in 
           the UI might make it too cluttered.
        2. The user needs to know the exact `ParticipantId` of the participant they want to view, which is not a 
           trivial task.

The following is the sequence diagram for how a `ViewCommand` works internally.

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/DG-images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![ViewCommandActivityDiagram](images/DG-images/ViewCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Add/Remove participant to/from event feature - enroll/expel

This feature allows Managera users to quickly add/remove a participant to/from an event according to the current 
filtered list of events and participants visible to the user.

#### Implementation Details

Since the `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input, 
we can simply add new `commandType` cases for `AddParticipantToEventCommand` and `RemoveParticipantFromEventCommand` 
in `AddressBookParser`

A `AddParticipantToEventParser` parses the user's input and obtain indexes for the participant and event respectively. 
If the indexes given by the user are not zero-based indexes, a `ParseException` will be thrown before the parser 
creates the command itself to prevent any further error. If all indexes are valid, an `AddParticipantToEventCommand` 
will be created by the parser.

The `AddParticipantToEventCommand` created by `AddParticipantToEventParser` contains 2 zero-based indexes. 
The first one is used to identify the `Participant` while the second is used to identify the `Event`. 
When the command is executed, the `model` first tries to obtain the `Participant` at specified index (if unsuccessful, 
a `CommandException` will be thrown accordingly) and then the `Event` will be retrieved in the same manner 
(if unsuccessful, a `CommmandException` will be thrown accordingly). If the `Event` does not already contain the 
`Participant`, the `Participant` will be added to the `Event` accordingly. Otherwise, a `CommandException` will 
be thrown.

A `RemoveParticipantFromEventParser` parses the user's input and obtain indexes for the participant and event 
respectively. The workflow is nearly identical to `AddParticipantToEvent` with one difference: instead of throwing 
`CommandException` if `Participant` already exists in the event, the `CommandException` will be thrown when 
`Participant` *does not* exist in the event. Otherwise, the participant will be removed from the event. 


#### Implementation Rationale

Since the command implies that the index of the participant should come before the index of the event, there is no 
need for prefixes to be used as that would incur extra typing for the user and slow down the process of adding/removing
participants to/from events.

The following activity diagrams summarise what happens when a user executes a new command in each case:

`AddParticipantToEvent` command:

![AddParticipantToEventActivityDiagram](images/DG-images/AddParticipantToEventByIndexActivityDiagram.png)

`RemoveParticipantFromEvent` command:

![RemoveParticipantFromEventActivityDiagram](images/DG-images/RemoveParticipantByIndexActivityDiagram.png)

The command keywords to add/remove participant to/from events are `enroll` and `expel` respectively as many users 
found `addParticipant` and `removeParticipant` to be too long. This problem becomes apparent since these commands are 
used regularly and are core features of Managera.

### View event's details feature - showDetails

This feature allows Managera users to find an event by name and view its details. The search is done using the event's 
index in the displayed event list.

#### Implementation Details

Since the `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input, we 
can simply add a new `commandType` case for `ShowEventDetailsCommand` in `AddressBookParser`.

The `ShowEventDetailsCommandParser` reads the user's input and passes it to `ParserUtil` which returns an `Index`. 
If the index given by the user is not a zero-based index, a `ParseException` will be thrown before the parser 
creates the command to prevent any further error. If the index is valid, a `ShowEventDetailsCommand` will be created 
by the parser with the created `Index`.

When the command is executed, there is a check to ensure the index is within the range of the displayed list. If the
index is out of range, a `CommandException` is thrown, and an error message is displayed to the user. Otherwise, the
execution will continue, and `model` will obtain the event by getting the `Event` with the given `Index`
from the `FilteredList<Event>` before displaying the event's details to the user.

#### Implementation Rationale

Since each event has a unique index in the displayed event list, it provides a convenient way for the user to look for a
specific event if index is used as the criterion. 

Another command similar in function is `findEvent`, where the model will filter the existing event list and display the 
events with names that contain a given keyword. However, this implementation is meant for returning a list of possibly 
multiple events. Since we are only looking for one particular event, we decided that instead of filtering the event 
list to display just the one event, we leave the event list untouched and simply return the event details to the 
results display.

#### Design Considerations:
##### Aspect: Similar event names:

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Find by index:
    * Pros:
        1. The details of the specific event are returned immediately, provided that the user's input is a valid index 
           in the displayed event list.
        2. Simple implementation.
    * Cons:
        1. The user has to know the index of the event, which can be troublesome with a long list of events. However,
           the user can use the `findEvent` function to filter their search, making this process slightly easier.

* **Alternative 2**: Find by exact name:
    * Pros:
        1. The details of the specific event are returned immediately, provided that the user's input is an exact
           match of the event's name.
        2. Relatively simple implementation.
    * Cons:
        1. The user has to know the exact name of the event, otherwise no events, or the wrong event, may be found.
        2. If the event name is long, typographical errors are likely, resulting in the desired event not being found.


* **Alternative 3**: Find by similar names or a given keyword:
    * Pros:
        1. A list of events with names that contain the user's input are returned, offering greater flexibility
           if the user does not fully recall the entire name of the event they are looking for. The search can be
           further refined by subsequent user input to narrow it down to the specific event.
    * Cons:
        1. Relatively harder implementation.
        2. Might be more troublesome and time-consuming to have to refine the search multiple times.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

![ShowEventDetailsActivityDiagram](images/DG-images/ShowEventDetailsActivityDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undone event feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undone event feature is an add-on command to the current implementation of Managera. Since
the `AddressBookParser` is responsible for determining the type of `Command` to be created from user input,
a new `commandType` for `UndoneEventCommand` needs to be added to `AddressBookParser`.

An `UndoneEventCommandParser` is needed to parse the user's input and creates an `Index` representing the position of
the event in the event list. The `UndoneEventCommand` created by `UndoneEventCommandParser` will contain the `Index`
of the event in the displayed event list to be undone. When the command is executed, the `model` will retrieve the 
`Event` at the specified `Index` and change the completion status of the `Event`.

### \[Proposed\] Enroll and expel multiple participants from multiple events feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The current implementation of `AddParticipantToEventCommand`(enroll) and `RemoveParticipantFromEventCommand`(expel)
only allows the enrolling/expelling of a single participant to/from a single event. To extend this feature to:

1. Enroll/Expel a participant to/from multiple events.
2. Enroll/Expel multiple participants to/from an event.
3. Enroll/Expel multiple participants to/from multiple events.

It is recommended to incorporate the use of the `Prefix` class in these commands. Instead of the current syntax of
`enroll PARTICIPANT_INDEX EVENT_INDEX` and `expel PARTICPANT_INDEX EVENT_INDEX`. A change to 
`enroll pid/PARTICIPANT_INDEXES... eid/EVENT_INDEXES...` and `expel pid/PARTICIPANT_INDEXES... eid/EVENT_INDEXES...`
allows these cases to be possible. The `model` will then add/remove each of the specified participants to/from each 
of the specified events.

## **Appendix: Effort**

A significant volume of effort was put in developing Managera from AB3: AB3 deals primarily with only one entity Person,
whereas we designed Managera to handle two entities, Participant and Event, and their interactions.

Major modifications include:
- Adding an entirely new entity type Event
- Adapting the Person class into a Participant class, removing Tag and adding BirthDate and NextOfKin attributes
- Adding the ParticipantID class to simplify storage process and coupling of participants and events
- Designing new commands for both Event and Participant for filtering, sorting, viewing details and adding and removing 
  participants to and from events
- Rerouting some CommandResult outputs to the results display for better user readability
- Redesigning the GUI

While some of the command classes from Person were adapted or used in a similar way by Event and Participant, necessary
changes were made to accommodate the new attributes (eg. removing Tag and adding BirthDate parameters when adding or 
editing a participant, changing the definition of duplicate participants), and new logic was designed for the adding and
removing of participants to and from events.
