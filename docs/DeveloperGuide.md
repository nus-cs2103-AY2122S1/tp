### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initialises the components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the App's data in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteStudent 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java).

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `TeacherListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

![Structure of the MeetingWindow UI Component](images/UiMeetingClassDiagram.png)

The `MeetingWindow` is made up of parts as well e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MeetingListPanel` which, similar to `MainWindow`, also inherits from the abstract `UiPart`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student`, `Teacher` and `Meeting` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="600"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it determines which window the user is on, and uses either the `MeetingParser` or `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command. It uses `MeetingParser` if the user is executing the command from the meeting window, and `AddressBookParser` if the user is executing the command from the main window.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteStudent 1")` API call.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** When the user calls a valid command 
from the `Meeting` window, the interaction within the `Logic` component only has 1 key difference: `LogicManager` 
calls the `MeetingParser#parseCommand`. The rest of the implementation is similar to the diagram below.
</div>

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteStudent 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works (we describe only for `AddressBookParser`, the one for `MeetingParser` is similar):
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />


The `Model` component,

* stores NewAddressBook data i.e., all `Student`, `Teacher` and `Meeting` objects, which are contained in `UniqueStudentList`, `UniqueTeacherList` and `NonConflictMeetingList` objects respectively.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` and `Teacher` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` and `ObservableList<Teacher>` respectively. It can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* a stack, `history`, to  keep track of address book histories. This is to facilitate the `undo` command.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).
* As there is no feature to search meetings, there is no need to store a filtered meeting list.


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="700" height="600" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
  **Note:** The lifeline each diagram should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.
</div>

### Undo feature

#### Implementation details

The undo mechanism is facilitated by a stack inside `ModelManager`. Every time the address book updates, a copy of the address book is made and pushed on the stack. As such, `ModelManager` exposes the `undo()` method to pop a previous version of an address book from the stack and reload its contents.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
  **Note:** It is needed for one to store a **copy** of the address book, otherwise any modifications to the existing address book would also alter the copies in the stack.
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The app creates an address book with the initial address book state, and a copy of this address book, `ab0`, will be pushed into the stack.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `deleteStudent 1` command to delete the 1st student in the address book. The `deleteStudent` command calls `ModelManager#deleteStudent`, which deletes the student from the existing address book, and then pushes a copy of the modified address book, `ab1`, onto the stack.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `student n/David …​` to add a new student. This command calls command also calls `ModelManager#addStudent`, causing another copy of the modified address book, `ab2`, to be pushed onto the stack.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
  **Note:** If a command fails its execution, a new address book will not be pushed onto the stack.
</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `ModelManager#undo`, which will pop the front element from the stack and restore `ab2`'s contents. The top of the stack is now `ab1`.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
  **Note:** If the stack has size 1, it means that copy of the address book inside the stack is the same as when the app first started. In this case, the app does not execute the `undo` operation, but rather tells the user that they are already at the oldest change.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** In the event the user executes `undo` from the meeting window, `MeetingParser` will be used instead. 
</div>


The `undoSuccess` variable in the above diagram is a `boolean`. It is `true` if the undo is a success, `false` otherwise. The undo command could fail if the app is already at the oldest change (ie. the stack size is 1). `undoSuccess` then determines what the `commandResult` will be. 



#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How `undo` executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself. For instance, have an `UndoDeleteStudent` command, `UndoEditTeacher` command etc...
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteStudent`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

We chose Alternative 1 because of the limited timespan of our project. Also, given that modern computers have large memory, it will not be a problem to store multiple copies of address books if the address book size is not too large.

**Aspect: Behaviour of `undo` across the main window and meeting window:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** We have a single `undo` command, and executing the command undoes the last action by the user.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May be confusing to the user to execute the `undo` command in one window and the change being reflected in another window.

* **Alternative 2:** We have two separate commands: `undo` and `undoMeeting`, such that `undo` undoes the last action by the user in the main window while `undoMeeting` undoes the last action by the user in the meeting window.
  * Pros: It is less confusing for the user (as now if the `undo/undoMeeting` command is executed in a particular window, the change will be reflected in the same window).
  * Cons: Harder to implement.

We eventually settled on Alternative 1 because our current implementation of the `AddressBook` class stores all the student, teacher and meeting lists together, and because we are using a stack to manage previous versions of our address book, it is more convenient to push the entire address book onto the stack rather than creating a separate class to store meetings.

### Copy Command

#### Implementation details
The `CopyStudentCommand/CopyTeacherCommand` classes extends the `Command` class with the ability to copy a selected field either from a list of students or a list of teachers. This is done via the method `CopyStudentCommand#getCopyContent` (similarly for teachers). This command works on the last shown list to the user, which means the user could filter the student list and copy the subset of students filtered. This works similarly for teachers as well. 

As such, this command is supported by the method in the `Model` interface, namely the `Model#getFilteredStudentList()` and `Model#getFilteredTeacherList()` methods.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the copy mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The current `filteredStudentList` and `filteredTeacherList`
will be initialised with all the students and teachers respectively from the loaded book data.

Step 2. The user executes `copyStudent c/name` to copy all the names of the students that are currently shown in the GUI. The `copyStudent` command calls `Model#getFilteredStudentList`, loading the current list of filtered students, which in this case is all the students from the loaded book data. Afterwards, the `copyStudent` command calls its own `getCopyContent` method, which then calls `CopyCommand#getNameContent` since the user wants to copy all names of students,
appending all the names of the students in the filtered student list to the user's clipboard.

The following sequence diagram shows how the copy operation works for a copyStudent command. The `copyTeacher` command works similarly, so we will only discuss `copyStudent` here. If the user specifies another field to be copied, such as `phone` or `email`, the command also works similarly, so we will not discuss them here.

![CopySequenceDiagram](images/CopySequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** The `copyStudent/copyTeacher` command does not copy anything to the clipboard if the last shown list is empty.
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Functionality of copy command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `copyStudent/copyTeacher` only allows the user to copy a subset of fields (ie. phone, email, name), and the fields that can be copied are the same for both students and teachers.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: It is easier for the user to remember which fields can be copied. For example, in our implementation, users simply have to remember that only the phone, email and name fields can be copied, for both teachers and students.
    * Cons: Users will not be able to copy other fields.

* **Alternative 2:** `copyStudent/copyTeacher` allows the user to copy any field they like.
    * Pros: The user has more flexibility in which fields they want to copy.
    * Cons: The user has to precisely remember which fields a student or teacher has. For example, the user would have to remember that he/she can copy down the office table numbers for teachers, but not for students. Similarly, he/she would have to remember that the emergency contact number of students can be copied, but not for teachers.

We went with Alternative 1 because we felt that other than a person's phone, email and name, there are very few use cases which would lead one to need to copy down another field. For example, unless it is for a very specific purpose, it is unlikely that the user would need to copy down office table numbers.


### Adding meetings

#### Implementation Details
The mechanism of adding meetings is showcased in the sequence diagram below:

![MeetSequenceDiagram](images/MeetSequenceDiagram.png)

![MeetSequenceDiagram](images/MeetSequenceDiagramRef.png)

Whenever a `Meeting` object is added to the `NonConflictMeetingList`, 
the `Meeting` will be inserted in a way such that the earliest meeting (in terms of date and time) is at the top of the list, and the latest meeting is at the back of the list. 
This allows users to focus on the more recent upcoming meetings.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Representation of a Meeting**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Meeting is not linked with any contacts in NewAddressBook.
  * Pros: Users can have more flexibility in planning meetings with students/teachers/parents that are not stored in NewAddressBook.
  * Cons: Users will need to come up with their own title for each meeting to describe who they are meeting with.

* **Alternative 2:** Meeting references a Person (either Student or Teacher) stored in NewAddressBook.
  * Pros: Users just have to specify the type and index of the Person in the list and the UI would generate a pre-defined title with the specified person's name
  * Cons: Harder to implement, as there is a need to update or remove meetings whenever the referenced Person is updated or removed from NewAddressBook. Furthermore, users cannot schedule meetings 
  with persons that are not stored in NewAddressBook, e.g. parents.

We chose Alternative 1 because it makes the application easier to use and provides more flexibility. That way, users do not have to add in a contact into NewAddressBook in order to have a meeting with them.

### Filter command

#### Implementation details

We discuss only the student case here, since it is the same for teachers.

When a `filterStudent` is called, it uses the `filterStudentCommandParser` to parse the additional inputs given by the 
user, such as the filter categories given. It then creates a `StudentInvolvementContainsKeywordsPredicate` with the relevant keywords entered by the user, and passes this predicate object to the `FilterStudentCommand` which gets and updates the view using `model.getFilteredStudentList()` 
and `model.updateFilteredStudentList(predicate)`.

The following sequence diagram shows how it works for a filterStudent command.

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Functionality of filter:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filter performs an `AND` search by default.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, saves time.
    * Cons: The functionality of the filter command is limited.

* **Alternative 2:** Filter allows the user to say which arguments to exclude. For example, the user could key in something like `filterStudent including t/tag1 t/tag2 excluding t/tag3` to include all students with both `tag1` and `tag2` but not `tag3`.
    * Pros: Allows for greater options in filtering.
    * Cons: Harder to implement as it requires more advanced parsing to be done.

We went with Alternative 1 as we did not want to make the command too confusing for the user. Moreover, we did not want to make the format of this command too different from other commands since a parsing system was already implemented for us.

###  Adding medical history of students

#### Implementation Details
The `MedicalHistoryCommand` extends the `Command` class. When a `MedicalHistoryCommand` is called, it uses the
`MedicalHistoryCommandParser` to parse the inputs given by the user, which include the index of the student based on the 
list of students, and the desired medical history to assign to the student. The parser then passes the details to 
`MedicalHistoryCommand` which then updates the student with the desired medical history using 
`model.setStudent(studentToEdit, editedStudent)` and updates the view using `model.updateFilteredStudentList(predicate)`
This works as the command is supported by the method in the `Model` interface, specifically the `Model#setStudent()` and
`Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` methods.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The user cannot add medical history to teachers.
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism works.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `filteredStudentList` (and teacher list) will be 
initialised from the saved data.

Step 2. The user types the command `medical INDEX m/MEDICAL_HISTORY` to add the `medicalHistory` to the desired `student`
at `index`. The `medical` command calls `Model#getFilteredStudentList` to obtain the current list of students, then finds
the desired student based on the `index`, and proceeds to edit the `medicalHistory` field of the student. Then the 
`Model#updateFilteredStudentList` is called to show the updated list with the added `medicalHistory`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `medical` command works.

![AddMedicalHistorySequenceDiagram](images/AddMedicalDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to implement MedicalHistory:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add the `medicalHistory` only when the teacher wants to.
    * Pros: Saves the user time as most students do not have notable `medicalHistory`.
    * Cons: Slightly more complicated than forcing users to input a `medicalHistory` each time they add a student.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to use the `editStudent` command to edit the `medicalHistory`
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Not as specific as using the `medical` command.
  
* **Alternative 3:** Force users to input `medicalHistory` for each `student` they wish to add.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Does not make sense as most students do not have notable `medicalHistory`.

We went with Alternative 1 because it is only a small subset of students that have medical conditions, and so it made sense not to force the user to input `medicalHistory` for each `student`. Further, we did not want users to accidentally edit a student's medical condition while editing a student, thus it made sense to create a new command for the specific use case of updating a medical history.

###  ClearStudent / ClearTeacher Command

#### Implementation Details

We discuss only students here, since it is the same for teachers.

The clearStudentCommand classes extends the `Command` class with the ability to clear the current list of students that is being shown.
This is done via the method `Model#massDeleteStudent`. This command will act on the last shown list to the user,
which means that the user can filter the list of students and clear only those that are filtered. This works similarly for teachers as well

As such, this command is supported by the method in the `Model` interface,
namely the `Model#getFilteredStudentList` and `Model#getFilteredTeacherList`.

Given below is an example usage and how the clear mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The current `filteredStudentList` and `filteredTeacherList`
will be initialised with all the students and teachers respectively from the loaded book data.

Step 2. The user executes `filterStudent math` to get all the students with the string `math` in their involvement.
The filtered students will be stored in `Model#filteredStudent` and the list will be shown to the user.

Step 3. The user executes `ClearStudent` to clear the current list of filtered students.
The `ClearStudent` command calls `Model#massDeleteStudents`, deleting the students in the current filtered list from
both the `Model#filteredStudent` and `AddressBook#uniqueStudentList`.

Step 4. As the `Model#filteredStudent` is now empty, the GUI will now show an empty list of students.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clear operation works for a `clearStudent` command.
The `clearTeacher` command works similarly.

![ClearSequenceDiagram](images/ClearSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How `clearStudent/clearTeacher` executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**  Clears only the filtered list
    * Pros: Makes it more flexible for the user, so that they can selectively filter a list they want to delete.
    * Pros: Goes hand in hand with Filter/Find.
    * Cons: Harder to implement and may have a performance issue in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Clears the entire list
    * Pros: Easier to maintain as it will be the same as `ClearCommand` in AB3.
    * Cons: No way for the user to selectively mass delete.

We went with Alternative 1 because we felt it was better to give users the choice to specify which types of students they want cleared from their list. Besides, the objective of Alternative 2 can be achieved by simply executing `listStudent` and `clearStudent`.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage. 
3. Should be able to hold up to 1000 teachers without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage. 
4. Should be able to hold up to 1000 meetings without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
5. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
6. Should work without requiring an installer.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Involvement**: A label attached to each student/teacher specifying the person's involvement with the User.
* **Currently displayed list**: For students, for example, there are two lists that are maintained by the application. One is the full list of students. The other is the list which the user currently sees on screen. For various reasons, the list the user sees may not be the same as the full list of students (perhaps the user executed a `findStudent` command). When we say "currently displayed list" we mean the list that is currently shown to the user.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy it into an empty folder.

   2. Double-click the jar file, or execute it with the `java -jar newaddressbook.jar` command.

        Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** For the below, we just state test cases for students. Even though the commands for teachers and meetings could be different, the key ideas of what the test cases are meant to test remains the same. From now on, when we say `list`, we mean the **currently displayed list**.
</div>

### Basic contact management

This section tests the basic functionality of the application.

#### Adding a Student

1. Adding a student with all fields correct.

   1. Test case: `student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/3E1 em/999 i/Math class t/naughty`<br>

    1. Test case: `deleteStudent -1` <br>
        Expected: A message saying that the command format is invalid should show up.

### Editing Fields

This section tests the editing functionality of the application. We have to be extra careful here to make sure we do not do anything when the user provides the same fields to edit multiple times. Else, some `undo` operations might not be meaningful. For example, if the user repeatedly executes `editStudent 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` three times, we do not want to execute `undo` three times to undo the last action.

#### Editing students

1. Edit a student with valid index and parameters.

   1. Test case: `medical 1 m/`<br>
      Expected: The medical history of the first student is removed.

1. Editing a student's medical history with one that he already has.

   1. Prerequisites: The list has at least one person.

   1. Test case: execute **twice** `medical 1 m/dead`<br>

      Expected: An error saying that the student already has same medical history should show up.

### Find and filter
These commands test the finding/filtering capabilities of the application.

1. Find matching conditions: checks to make sure `findStudent` matches the **whole** word

   1. Prerequisites: clear the student list with `listStudent` and `clearStudent`. Add two students to the student list using `student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/3E1 em/999 i/Math class t/naughty` and `student n/John Smith p/98765432 e/johns@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/3E1 em/999 i/Math class t/naughty`

      Expected: No students should be listed.

   1. Test case: `findStudent Smith`<br>
      Expected: Only John Smith should be listed.

1. Filter matching conditions: checks to make sure `findStudent` matches **part** of the word, and that the search is an **AND** search

   1. Prerequisites: clear the student list with `listStudent` and `clearStudent`. Add two students to the student list using `student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/3E1 em/999 i/Math class t/naughty` and `student n/John Smith p/98765432 e/johns@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/3E1 em/999 i/English class t/naughty t/dead`

    1. Test case: `filterStudent t/naughty`<br>
    Expected: Both students should be listed.

### Date time management
This section tests if the date management is as expected. Since dates are only used in meetings, the tester would need to open up the meeting window.

#### Date management

   1. Prerequisites: open up the meeting window with `showMeeting`.

   1. Test case: `meet r/Meeting with Ms.Lee d/2040-07-12 14:08 v/Seminar room 3 w/P`<br>
    This is a valid meeting date and hence should be accepted.

   1. Test case: `meet r/Meeting with Ms.Lee d/2040:07-12 14:08 v/Seminar room 3 w/P`<br>
    A message saying that the user's date time input is invalid should pop out.

  1. Test case: `meet r/Meeting with Ms.Lee d/2019-07-12 14:08 v/Seminar room 3 w/P`<br>
    A message saying that the meeting date should be in the future should pop up.

  1. Test case: `meet r/Meeting with Ms.Lee d/2022-7-12 14:08 v/Seminar room 3 w/P`<br>
    A message saying that the user's date time input is invalid should pop out. The user is supposed to pad it with zeroes if the month is single digit.

  1. Test case: `meet r/Meeting with Ms.Lee d/2028-02-29 14:08 v/Seminar room 3 w/P`<br>
    This is a valid meeting date and hence should be accepted. 2028 is a leap year.

  1. Test case: `meet r/Meeting with Ms.Lee d/2029-02-29 14:08 v/Seminar room 3 w/P`<br>
    A message saying that the user's date time input is invalid should pop out. 2029 is not a leap year.

#### Time management

  1. Prerequisites: open up the meeting window with `showMeeting`.

  1. Test case: `meet r/Meeting with Ms.Lee d/2029-01-29 24:08 v/Seminar room 3 w/P`<br>
    A message saying that the user's date time input is invalid should pop out. 24:08 is not a valid time.

### Window management
This section ensures that the application "knows" about where the user is executing the commands from.

#### Window specific commands

  1. Prerequisites: open up the meeting window with `showMeeting`.
  
  1. Test case: In the main window, execute `meet`.<br>
    The app should respond that the command is invalid.

  1. Test case: In the meeting window, execute `meet`.<br>
    The app should respond that it knows the command, but the format is invalid.

#### Undo across various windows

This tests if `undo` works as expected multiple windows. 

  1. Prerequisites: open up the meeting window with `showMeeting`. In the main window, execute `editStudent 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`.  In the meeting window, execute `meet r/Meeting with Ms.Lee d/2029-02-21 14:08 v/Seminar room 3 w/P`.

  2. Test case: execute `undo` in the **main** window. <br>
    The meeting added should be cleared, but the effects of the first command should still be there.

### Undo command

The `undo` command needs extra testing, because it integrates with a lot of other commands.

1. Undo success

   1. Prerequisites: clear the student list with `listStudent` and `clearStudent`. Add two students to the student list using `student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/3E1 em/999 i/Math class t/naughty` and `student n/John Smith p/98765432 e/johns@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/3E1 em/999 i/English class t/naughty t/dead`.

   2. Test case: Execute `undo` two times.<br>
    Both students should be removed.

1. Undo at oldest change

   1. Prerequisites: Clear the student list with `listStudent` and `clearStudent`. Close the app and reopen it. Add two students to the student list using `student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/3E1 em/999 i/Math class t/naughty` and `student n/John Smith p/98765432 e/johns@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/3E1 em/999 i/English class t/naughty t/dead`.

   2. Test case: Execute `undo` **three** times.<br>
    Both students should be removed. On the last `undo`, the application should tell the user that he/she is already at the oldest change.

1. Undo an edit action that does nothing

   1. Prerequisites: clear the student list with `listStudent` and `clearStudent`. Add a student list using `student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com g/M a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 f/3E1 em/999 i/Math class t/naughty`. Now edit that student using `editStudent 1 i/Math class`. An error message should show up, saying that 

   2. Test case: Execute `undo` once.<br>
    The added student should be removed. It shouldn't take two `undo` actions to do so as the `editStudent` command did nothing.


### Saving data

This section deals with test cases that come with saving data.

#### Deleted data files

  1. Quit the application and delete `data/newaddressbook.json`. Reopen the application.

## **Appendix: Effort**
The following describes some of the challenges faced when developing NewAddressBook:

1. Refactoring existing code. <br>
While AB3 deals with only one entity type (`Person`), NewAddressBook supports managing two different types of contacts, namely
`Student` and `Teacher`. And given that each type of contact has its own set of attributes, we could not
store them in a single collection and had to split them. Naturally, we had to split most of the commands
to cater to each type of contacts so that when the user operates on one, the other is not affected. A huge
amount of effort was required for this process.


2. Meetings window. <br>
Apart from managing contacts, NewAddressBook also allows users to keep track of upcoming meetings.
There is thus a need to display a list of meetings to the user. Our final product has a separate window
that displays the list of meetings, in addition to the existing students list and teachers list.
Initially, we wanted to keep everything in one window. However,
we realised that choosing this option would mean that we would need to fit all three lists
(students list, teachers list and meetings list) into a single window, which would then require us 
to reduce the display sizes of these lists. We feel that this is undesirable as this would restrict
the amount of information that users can see. While we had another option, which was to display only
one list at a time and allow users to navigate between different lists, we did not consider this option as
we want users to be able to view the lists at the same time when there is a need to. This leaves us
with the last option, which is to create a second window for meetings. We also decided to allow users
to enter meeting-specific commands from the meetings window instead of having to go back to the main 
window. This required us to reimplement the parser in the `Logic` component to be able to identify
which window that the command is being entered from.
