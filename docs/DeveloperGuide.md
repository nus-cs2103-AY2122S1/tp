### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BirthdayReminderListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The Activity Diagram below accompanies the `DeleteCommand`.

![Activity Diagram of Delete Command](images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and creates an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores and sorts the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. The `Person` objects are sorted according to how they should be displayed.
* stores and sorts the `Person` objects as a separate _sorted_ list according to their birthday which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a set of `Prefix` objects which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `Set<Prefix>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this set so that the UI can use this data.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Tags

#### Implementation

Tags for contacts are implemented as a `Tag` class and are stored internally in a `Set<Tag>` within the `Person` object. Tags are parsed and created through the `add`, `edit` and `tag` commands, and removed through the `edit` and `untag` commands. Multiple **distinct** tags can also be added for each contact.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes the `add ... t/friend` command to add a contact tagged with `friend` into CONNECTIONS.

Step 3. CONNECTIONS displays the newly added contact with the added tag.

Step 4. The user decides to add additional tags to the contact at index 1, and executes `tag 1 t/classmate`.

Step 5. CONNECTIONS will update the specified contact to include the new tag `classmate`.

Step 6. The user decides to remove the tag `student` from a contact at index 3, and executes `untag 3 t/student`.

Step 7. CONNECTIONS updates and removes the tag `student` from the contact.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

* **Option 1 (Current choice): Tags are saved within a `Set<Tag>` within `Person`**
  * Pros: Easy to implement and doesn't allow for duplicates. 
  * Cons: Searching for contacts by tags may be slow, especially if there are many contacts, with each contact having multiple tags.
  
* **Option 2: Utilize a separate `HashMap` data structure to map contacts to tags.**
  * Pros: Fast retrieval of tagged contacts.
  * Cons: Difficult to maintain a separate data structure.

### Pin feature

#### Implementation


The pin mechanism is facilitated by `UniquePersonList`. It stores all the list of contacts in CONNECTIONS and maintains the order of these contacts according to if they are pinned or not. Pinned contacts have a higher priority and hence are displayed first. It currently implements the following operations:
* `UniquePersonList#add` - adds a contact into the list of stored contacts and stores the contacts according to their priority. 
* `UniquePersonList#setPerson` - updates an edited contact in the list of stored contacts and stores the contacts according to their priority. 

The operation is exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#Execute`, specifically in `PinCommand#Execute`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the pin mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. Current `UniquePersonList` will contain previously added contacts `person1` and `person2`.

![PinUniquePersonListState0](images/PinUniquePersonListState0.png)

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

Step 2. The user executes `add n/person3 â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. This contact is initially unpinned and will be added to the `UniquePersonList`. It will be added to the end of the `UniquePersonList`.

![PinUniquePersonListState1](images/PinUniquePersonListState1.png)

Step 3. CONNECTIONS UI displays the new contact at the end of `PersonListPanel` using a `PersonCard`.

Step 4. The user decides that `person3` will be frequently contacted and should be pinned. The user executes `pin 3`.

Step 5. Contact's `Pin` attribute will change to indicate that the contact is pinned. Contact will be brought forward in `UniquePersonList`, behind `person1` that was already pinned.

![PinUniquePersonListState2](images/PinUniquePersonListState2.png)

Step 6. CONNECTIONS UI will update to show the new contact at the top of the list using a `PinnedPersonCard` which shows a pin next to the contact's name. 

Step 7. The user decides that `person3` will no longer be frequently contacted and should be unpinned. The user executes `unpin 2` which unpins `person3` which is second in the list.

Step 8. Contact's `Pin` attribute will change to indicate that the contact is not pinned. Contact will be moved behind other pinned contacts in `UniquePersonList`.

![PinUniquePersonListState3](images/PinUniquePersonListState3.png)

Step 9. CONNECTIONS UI will update to show the contact behind other pinned contacts using a `PersonCard`. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `pin` operation works:

![PinSequenceDiagram](images/PinSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `PinCommandParser` and `PinCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


The following activity diagram shows possible user interactions with a `pin` command.
![PinActivityDiagram](images/PinActivityDiagram.png)


The following activity diagram shows possible user interactions with a `unpin` command.
![UnpinActivityDiagram](images/UnpinActivityDiagram.png)


<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How pin executes:**

* **Option 1:** Contact has a boolean field isPinned to indicate if the contact is pinned or not.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, less memory usage.
    * Cons: Less flexibility in expanding the usage of pin.

* **Option 2 (current choice):** Contact has Pin object to indicate if the contact is pinned or not.
    * Pros: More flexible to expand, other methods can be added to Pin if needed.
    * Cons: Will use more memory.

**Aspect: How each pinned contact is displayed:**

* **Option 1 (current choice):** Have two separate cards, `PersonCard` and `PinnedPersonCard`, for a unpinned contact and pinned contact respectively.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: More code duplication.

* **Option 2:** Have one card that will add a pin if the contact is pinned.
    * Pros: Harder to implement.
    * Cons: Less code duplication.

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The operation is exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#Execute`, specifically in `FindCommand#Execute`.

The filtered list will be updated using `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList`. A `FindPredicate` is generated according to the user's command and passed as an argument into `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList`.
It will be displayed in `PersonListPanel`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. All contacts are displayed by default.

Step 2. The user executes `find n/David t/friend t/football` to search for a matching contact.

Step 3. A `FindPredicate`  which will only return `true` if contact's name contains `David` **while also having** `friend` **and**
`football` tagged to them is made.

Step 4. This`FindPredicate` is passed into `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList`, updating the filtered list.

Step 5. CONNECTIONS' `UI` observes the filtered list and displays the updated filtered list in `PersonListPanel`. Only contacts whose name contains `David` **while also having** `friend` **and**
`football` tagged to them will be displayed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Find operation works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser`, `FindPredicate` and `FindCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How Find executes:**

* **Option 1:** Utilize two predicates, one to check if contact's Name contains the keywords and one to check if contact's Tag(s) contains the keywords.
    * Pros: Straightforward.
    * Cons: Introduces additional and unnecessary complexities to ModelManager.

* **Option 2 (current choice):** Create a `FindPredicate` to store Name and Tag(s)
    * Pros: Cleaner implementation. Only need to modify a method to modify the functionality of `FindCommand`.
    * Cons: More code.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### FindAny feature

#### Implementation

The operation is exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#Execute`, specifically in `FindAnyCommand#Execute`.

The filtered list will be updated using `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList`. A `FindAnyPredicate` is generated according to the user's command and passed as an argument into `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList`.
It will be displayed in `PersonListPanel`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the FindAny mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. All contacts are displayed by default. 

Step 2. The user executes `findAny n/David n/Henry t/friend t/football` to search for a matching contact.

Step 3. A `FindAnyPredicate`  which will only return `true` if contact's name contains **either** `David` **or** `Henry` **OR** are
tagged to **either** `friend` **or** `football` is made.

Step 4. This`FindAnyPredicate` is passed into `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList`, updating the filtered list.

Step 5. CONNECTIONS' `UI` observes the filtered list is updated and displayed the updated filtered list in `PersonListPanel`.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the FindAny operation works:

![FindAnySequenceDiagram](images/FindAnySequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindAnyCommandParser`, `FindAnyPredicate` and `FindAnyCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How FindAny executes:**

* **Option 1:** Utilize two predicates, one to check if contact's Name contains the keywords and one to check if contact's Tag(s) contains the keywords.
    * Pros: Straightforward.
    * Cons: Introduces additional and unnecessary complexities to ModelManager.

* **Option 2 (current choice):** Create a `FindAnyPredicate` to store Name and Tag(s).
    * Pros: Cleaner implementation. Only need to modify a method to modify the functionality of `FindAnyCommand`.
    * Cons: More code.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Help feature

#### Implementation

The operation is exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#Execute`, specifically in `HelpCommand#Execute`.

Help messages will be displayed in the CONNECTIONS' `UI` through the `ResultDisplay`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Help mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `help` to seek help on CONNECTION's usage.

Step 3. CONNECTIONS displays a list of available commands in `ResultDisplay`.

Step 4. The user decides to view the usage of `add` to learn to add a contact, and executes `help add`.

Step 5. CONNECTIONS will display a detailed help message on the usage of the `add` command in `ResultDisplay`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Help operation works:

![HelpSequenceDiagram](images/HelpCommandDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `HelpCommandParser` and `HelpCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Birthday Reminder feature

#### Implementation

Shows a list of contacts with upcoming birthdays. This list of birthday reminders is displayed to the user through the `UI`, specifically in `BirthdayReminderListPanel`. Each birthday is displayed as a `BirthdayReminderCard`.
The list of birthdays is generated in the `ModelManager`, which implements the following functions:
* `ModelManager#getBirthdayReminderList` returns an `ObservableList<Person> birthdayReminders` that is ordered according to upcoming birthdays.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the birthday reminders mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. On app startup, contacts with a birthday are sorted by birth month and day. Contacts with birthdays that fall on the present day are colored green while birthdays that are within one week are colored blue. Additionally, a customized message with each contact's phone number and age will be displayed in the birthday reminder list.

Step 2. The `BirthdayReminderListPanel` in CONNECTIONS' `UI` displays birthday reminders in sorted order, starting with the earliest upcoming birthday to the latest upcoming birthday for the year, after which displays birthdays that have passed for the current year in sorted order.

Step 3. The user executes `add n/person3 b/01012000 â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. 

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

Step 4. CONNECTIONS will store the new contact. The `ObservableList<Person> birthdayReminders` for `BirthdayReminderPanelList` will be updated to include the new contact, ensuring the birthday reminder list remains sorted as shown below. 

![BirthdayReminderSequenceDiagram](images/BirthdayReminderSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Step 5. CONNECTIONS `UI` will observe for changes in the `ObservableList<Person> birthdayReminders` and update `BirthdayReminderPanelList`, displaying the new contact. 

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How will the `ObservableList<Person> birthdayReminders` update with a new contact:**

* **Option 1 (current choice):** Clear the birthday reminders and regenerate them.
    * Pros: Straightforward.
    * Cons: It will be slower as the whole list is regenerated.

* **Option 2:** Insert the contact into the list. 
    * Pros: Faster than the alternative.
    * Cons: Harder to implement and maintain.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Mailing List feature
Allows users to download a CSV file mailing list of the current view.  
Users can use arguments to specify which fields to include in their download.

#### Implementation
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Mailing List mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user filters the contacts using other commands, eg. `find`.  

Step 2. The `FilteredList` in `Model` is updated.  

Step 3. The UI is updated to reflect this new state.  

Step 4. The user provides a series of prefixes to `mailingList` to pick the fields. If no arguments are provided, default selectors are used.  

Step 5. These `Prefix` arguments are stored in `Model`.
![MailingListSequenceDiagram](images/MailingListSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `MailingListCommandParser` and `MailingListCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Step 6. The user is prompted to pick a name and the download location for their generated CSV file.   

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

Step 7. The `FilteredList`, `Prefixes` and `Path` are passed to `CsvUtil#modelToCsv`, which will serialize and write the CSV file.  

![MainWindowMailingListActivityDiagram.](images/MainWindowMailingListActivityDiagram.png)  

Step 8. The header row is created based on `Prefix` arguments stored in `Model`, based on a mapping in `CsvUtil`.  

Step 9. Individual rows are generated based on the `Prefix` arguments stored in `Model` and the `FilteredPerson` in `ModelManager`, based on a mapping in `CsvUtil`.  

Step 10. The headers and rows are written to the CSV file that is specified by the user.  

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Front end design considerations:
* Arguments for the command should follow the standard used in other parts of the software.
* Balancing between simplicity of use when no arguments are provided, and flexibility for users who might want additional information.

#### Back end design considerations:
* **Option 1:** Store serialized CSV data in CommandResult and pass it directly to CsvUtil
    * Pros: Straightforward.
    * Cons: Requires large changes to the attributes and purpose of CommandResult. 

* **Option 2 (current choice):** Store data in model and access using logic
    * Pros: Minimal changes to CommandResult structure are necessary.
    * Cons: Additional calls to logic and model are needed to get the required information.


### Command History feature

#### Implementation

The operation is exposed in `CommandBox` and `CommandHistory`.

The user keystroke will be read in `CommandBox#handleKeyStroke`, which will call the appropriate method in `CommandHistory` to retrieve the previous and next commands. The retrieved commands are passed into `CommandBox#commandTextField` to be displayed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Command History mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. All contacts are displayed by default.

Step 2. The user executes `find n/David t/friend t/football` to search for a matching contact.

Step 3. User wants to retrieve previous command and presses the `UP` key.

Step 4. `CommandBox#handleKeyStroke` reads the `UP` keystroke and calls `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand`.

Step 5. `CommandHistory` retrieves the previous command and returns it.

Step 6. `CommandBox` displays the previous command in the Command Box.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram shows possible user interactions with the command history feature.

![CommandHistoryActivityDiagram](images/CommandHistoryActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Implementation of Command History:**

* **Option 1 (current choice):** Generate `CommandHistory` as a Singleton class.
    * Pros: Ensures that there is only one set of history that is tracked.
    * Cons: Complicates testing as different versions of history cannot be created.

* **Option 2:** Generate `CommandHistory` as a normal class.
    * Pros: Makes testing easier as multiple `CommandHistory` objects can be created with different history to test different conditions.
    * Cons: Possible conflicting history if `CommandHistory` is not updated properly.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Command Assistant feature

#### Implementation

The operation is exposed in `SystemCommand`, specifically in `SystemCommand#execute`.

The user keystroke will be read in `CommandBox#handleKeyStroke`. The user input will be evaluated by `SystemCommand#execute` to determine the appropriate help message to display.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Command Assistant mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. All contacts are displayed by default.

Step 2. The user enters `find ` to search for a matching contact.

Step 3. `CommandBox#handleKeyStroke` reads `find ` input string and calls `SystemCommand#execute`.

Step 4. `SystemCommand` evaluates the user input and returns the appropriate help message.

Step 5. CONNECTIONS will display a help message in `ResultDisplay`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Implementation of Command Assistant:**

* **Option 1:** Create a `AssistantCommand` class which extends from `Command` to handle the features of `Command Assistant`.
    * Pros: Simplifies implementation as only an additional subclass needs to be created.
    * Cons: Creates an additional command that users may be able to utilise, which they are not supposed to.

* **Option 2 (current choice):** Create a new type of command called `SystemCommand` that does not extend from `Command`.
    * Pros: Prevents potential issues such as users using an additional command which they are not supposed to use.
    * Cons: Requires additional code to interface with `Logic`, `MainWindow` and `CommandBox`.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### [Proposed] Partial data recovery feature
Allows the user to recover partial data if the data file becomes corrupted. 

#### Proposed Implementation
Currently, if the data file is corrupted, CONNECTIONS will use an empty data file upon start up. 
The proposed implementation can be facilitated by `JsonAdaptedPerson` and `JsonAddressBookStorage`. Upon getting an invalid data format for compulsory fields, `JsonAdaptedPerson` can return `null` and 
not be added to `JsonAddressBookStorage`. If optional fields are corrupt, default values can be used. This allows other contacts and the other fields of the corrupt contact to be recovered. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Help mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user edits the data file and changes the `Tag` field of the first contact to an invalid value.

Step 2. The user edits the data file and changes the `Email` field of the second contact to an invalid value.

Step 3. Upon start up, `JsonAddressBookStorage` attempts to load the data file. Since the value of `Tag` (optional field) for the first contact is invalid, `JsonAdaptedPerson` will not add the invalid `Tag`.

Step 4. Since the value of `Email` (compulsory field) for the second contact is invalid, `JsonAdaptedPerson` returns `null` which is not added to `JsonAddressBookStorage`.

Step 3. CONNECTIONS will not display the first contact's invalid `Tag` and will not display the second contact. The other fields and contacts will be displayed as per normal.
