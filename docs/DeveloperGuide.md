# **LeadsForce - Developer Guide**

By: `AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **1. Introduction**

LeadsForce is a desktop app that is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Catered towards student financial advisors, LeadsForce makes the process of managing client information seamless! LeadsForce does this by helping the financial advisors store and retrieve client information effortlessly and seamlessly.

LeadsForce's developer Guide is written for developers who wish to contribute to or extend our project. It is technical, and explains the inner workings of LeadsForce and how the different components of our application work together.

## **3. Design**

### 3.1 Architecture
<p align="center">
<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />
</p>

LeadsForce is a brown field project adapted and developed upon from **AddressBook3**. Our team decided on reusing the overall architecture by maintaining the system with 6 components (as listed in the diagram above) while building upon each component to cater to the needs of LeadsForce. The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App, which was adapted from **AddressBook3**. In the subsequent chapters, we will be providing an overview of the component, explain how each component works internally, and how you could scale the system, which can server as a guideline for the developers to expand LeadsForce.

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four main components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface.

</p>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
</p>
The sections below give more details of each component.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<p align="center">
<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" alt="Structure of UI component" width="800" />
</p>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

LeadsForce's GUI is primarily adapted from `AddressBook3`, with the addition of a `SideBar` that conveniently displays information for the user.

Our `SideBar` has a `ClientViewPanel`, which like the `ClientCard`, has a dependency on the `Model` class to fully display the information of the `Client` of interest to the user.

In addition, the `SideBar` also has a `MeetingListPanel`, which holds a list of `NextMeetingCard`. `NextMeetingCard` has a dependency on the `Model` class to fully display all scheduled meetings of the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>
</p>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">‚ùóÔ∏è **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
</p>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />
</p>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* has a `UniqueNextMeetingList` in `AddressBook` , which contains all `NextMeeting` objects belonging to all `Client` objects in the `UniqueClientList` object.
* has a `UniqueTagList` in `AddressBook` , which contains `Tag`(s) that a `Client` can reference. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
    * this `ObservableList<Client>` is used for to get the `Client` object to display in `ClientListPanel` and `ClientViewPanel`
* stores all `NextMeeting` objects belonging to all `Client` objects as a separate _sorted_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<NextMeeting>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
    * this `ObservableList<NextMeeting>` is used for to get the `NextMeeting` object to display in `NextMeetingCard` in `MeetingsListPanel`
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user‚Äôs preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<p align="center">
<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />
</p>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.7 Client Fields

As client attributes often share a few similarities in their constraints, some with their own differences, we provide interfaces for developers to customise the constraints of client attributes.

#### 3.7.1 Field options

We provide options for developers to easily customise the constraints on the user input such as whether the input is required or whether it is editable. These field options are encapsulated within the `Field` interface, which further branches into more concrete interfaces which can be implemented by `Client` attributes.

Field options largely dictate how the parsers respond to user's inputs.

Option | Description
--- | ---
IS_BLANK_VALUE_ALLOWED | If set to `true`, the field is allowed to be blank (for string fields such as phone, name, etc). Default to `true`.
IS_NULL_VALUE_ALLOWED | If set to `true`, the field is allowed to be null (for int/Date fields such as LastMet, etc). Default to `true`.
DEFAULT_VALUE | The default value for the field. Set when user does not pass in the prefix on `Client` creation. Default to `""`.
IS_EDITABLE | If set to `true`, the field is editable by the user through edit command. Default to `true`.

#### 3.7.2 Field interfaces

<p align="center">
<img src="images/FieldClassDiagram.png" width="900" />
</p>

The following concrete interfaces inherit the `Field` interface. You can alternatively define your own interface or provide a concrete implementation of the field options within the `attribute` classes if they don't suit your needs.

##### 3.7.2.1 OptionalStringBasedField

Option | Default
--- | ---
IS_BLANK_VALUE_ALLOWED | `true`
IS_NULL_VALUE_ALLOWED | `false`
DEFAULT_VALUE | `""`
IS_EDITABLE | `true`

##### 3.7.2.2 OptionalNonStringBasedField

Option | Default
--- | ---
IS_BLANK_VALUE_ALLOWED | `true`
IS_NULL_VALUE_ALLOWED | `true`
DEFAULT_VALUE | `""`
IS_EDITABLE | `true`

##### 3.7.2.3 RequiredField

Option | Default
--- | ---
IS_BLANK_VALUE_ALLOWED | `false`
IS_NULL_VALUE_ALLOWED | `false`
DEFAULT_VALUE | `""`(But not used as value is required)
IS_EDITABLE | `true`

#### 3.7.3 FieldLength interfaces

<p align="center">
<img src="images/FieldLengthDiagram.png" width="700" />
</p>

There are FieldLength interfaces that contain a `MAX_LENGTH` field. This is used to help limit the number of characters that a user can input for a particular field.

FieldLength type | `MAX_LENGTH` value
--- | ---
StandardFieldLength | 30
ShorterFieldLength | 15
LongerFieldLength | 100

### 3.8 Comparable Client Attribute

All the clients attribute which the sort command support implements the IgnoreNullComparable interface to help
determine an ordering for the attributes.

#### 3.8.1 IgnoreNullComparable

The IgnoreNullComparable interface implements the Comparable interface and has the method compareWithDirection(T, SortDirection).
The compareWithDirection is similar to the compareTo in Comparable but has the following additional properties:
1) null or the null-equivalent of the attribute will be ordered last.
2) the ordering will also be determined by the SortDirection pass into it.

<img src="images/IgnoreNullComparable.png" />

#### 3.8.2 StringComparable

StringComparable is an abstract class which implements the IgnoreNullComparable interface which determine the ordering
of an attributes based on the lexicographical ordering of the string representation of the attribute.

#### 3.8.3 NumberComparable

NumberComparable is an abstract class which implements the IgnoreNullComparable interface which determine the ordering
of an attributes based on the numerical ordering of the number representation of the string representation of the
attribute.

#### 3.8.4 Attribute's Comparable Interface Summary

Attribute | Comparable Interface
--- | ---
Client Id | NumberComparable
Name | StringComparable
Email | StringComparable
Phone | NumberComparable
Address | StringComparable
Risk Appetite | NumberComparable
Disposable Income | Number Comparable
Last Met | IgnoreNullComparable
Next Meeting | IgnoreNullComparable

### 3.9 Prefix Mapper

The PrefixMapper is a utility class which provides a mapping of a prefix to the relevant methods for the attribute of that prefix.
This class help to simplify segments of code which require operations that are dependent on the prefix and its corresponding attribute.
The PrefixMapper contains a HashMap which map a prefix to their respective PrefixMapperElement.
A PrefixMapperElement contains getter & setter method and values that are relevant to an attribute.

PrefixMapperElement contains the following:
* Name of the Attribute
* Default value of the Attribute
* Client Attribute getter Function
* EditClientDescriptor Attribute setter BiConsumer
* EditClientDescriptor Attribute getter Function
* Attribute Parser Function

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## AddressBook feature

### 4.1 View Client Info

#### Description

LeadsForce allows users to view client info in the `ClientViewPanel` in the `SideBar` of the GUI using the `View` command.

#### Implementation

1. The `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. The remaining input text will be passed to the `ViewCommandParser` to parse.
4. The `ViewCommandParser` will parse the `ClientId` from the remaining input text. In our implementation, a valid `ClientId` is any non-negative integer.
5. The `ViewCommandParser` will then create a new `ClientHasId` using the `ClientId` parsed.
6. The `ViewCommandParser` will then create a `ViewCommand` with the `ClientId` and `ClientHasId`.
7. The `LogicManger` will call the `execute` method of `ViewCommand`.
8. The `ViewCommand` wil then call the `updateClientToView` method of the provided `Model` with it's `ClientHasId`.
9. The `ViewCommand` will finally create a new `CommandResult` which will be returned to `LogicManager` and the client's information with the given `ClientId` in the `ClientViewPanel`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />
</p>

#### Implementation of ClientHasId

`ClientHasId` implements `Predicate<Client>` and allow filtering of a list of `Client` based on `ClientId` objects. `ClientHasId` contains a list which holds these 'ClientId'. This allows the `Model` to use this list of `ClientId` objects to filter for `Client`(s) that contain the given `ClientId`(s).

### 4.2 Edit Client Info

#### Description

LeadsForce allows users to edit client info.

#### Implementation

1. The `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. The remaining input text will be passed to the `EditCommandParser` to parse.
4. The `EditCommandParser` will tokenize the remaining input text using the `ArgumentTokenizer` into an `ArgumentMultiMap`.
5. The `EditCommandParser` will then create a new `clientId` which contains the list of client Ids.
6. The `EditCommandParser` will then create a new `EditClientDescriptor` which contains the fields that the user is intending on editing.
7. The `EditCommandParser` will create a `EditCommand` containing both the list of client Ids and the `EditClientDescriptor`.
8. The `LogicManger` will call the `execute` method of the aforementioned `EditCommand`.
9. The `EditCommand` will then call the `setAllClients` method of the provided `Model` with the `EditClientDescriptor` and the list of clients.
10. The `EditCommand` will then call the `updateFilteredClientList` method of the provided `Model` with a predicate to show all clients in the client list.
12. The `EditCommand` will finally create a new `CommandResult` which will be returned to `LogicManager` and the client's information will be edited as according to the command input.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/tracing/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />
</p>

#### Implementation of EditClientDescriptor

The `EditClientDescriptor` keeps tracks of all the attributes that the user intends on updating, and does so by using the `set{ATTRIBUTE}` command for all the attributes of `Client`(such as setName, setPhone, etc.).

### 4.3 Search Clients

#### Description

LeadsForce allows the user to `search` for clients using keywords. The keywords can be used to match generically
with any client's attribute or specifically with the specified attributes

#### Implementation

1. The `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. The remaining input text will be passed to the `SearchCommandParser` to parse.
4. The `SearchCommandParser` will tokenize the remaining input text using the `ArgumentTokenizer` into an `ArgumentMultiMap`.
5. The `SearchCommandParser` will then create a new `ClientContainsKeywordPredicate` using the `ArgumentMultiMap`.
6. The `SearchCommandParser` will then create a `SearchCommand` with the `ClientContainsKeywordPredicate`.
7. The `LogicManger` will call the `execute` method of `SearchCommand`.
8. The `SearchCommand` wil then call the `updateFilteredClientList` method of the provided `Model` with it's `ClientContainsKeywordPredicate`.
9. The `SearchCommand` will finally create a new `CommandResult` which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the search operation works:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/tracing/SearchCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />
</p>

#### Implementation of ClientContainsKeywordPredicate

`ClientContainsKeywordPredicate` implements `Predicate<Client>` and allow filtering of a list of `Client` based on
generic and attribute keywords.`ClientContainsKeywordPredicate` contains an `ArgumentMultiMap` which holds these
keywords. The `preamble` string of the `ArgumentMultiMap` corresponds to generic keywords. All the words in that string
will be used to match with all the attributes of the `Client`. The different `values` String that is mapped to the
different `Prefix` corresponds to attribute keywords. Each of these `values` string will then be matched with the
corresponding `Client`'s attribute that their `Prefix` refers to e.g. if the `Prefix` `e/` was mapped to `@gmail.com`,
then `@gmail.com` will be used to matched with the `Email` attribute of the `Client`. For this predicate to return true,
the given `Client` must match with any of the generic keywords if there is any and all the attribute keywords if there
is any.

### 4.4 Filter Clients

#### Description

LeadsForce allows the user to `filter` for clients using keywords. This works similar to the `search` but it allows
for multiple `filter` to be stacked, which allows for user to look for clients incrementally.

#### Implementation

1. The `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser`
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. The remaining input text will be passed to the `FilterCommandParser` to parse.
4. The `FilterCommandParser` will tokenize the remaining input text using the `ArgumentTokenizer` into an `ArgumentMultiMap`.
5. The `FilterCommandParser` will then create a new `ClientContainsKeywordPredicate` using the `ArgumentMultiMap`.
6. The `FilterCommandParser` will then create a `FilterCommand` with the `ClientContainsKeywordPredicate`
7. The `LogicManger` will call the `execute` method of `FilterCommand`.
8. The `FilterCommand` wil then call the `filterFilteredClientList` method of the provided `Model` with it's `ClientContainsKeywordPredicate`.
9. The `FilterCommand` will finally create a new `CommandResult` which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/tracing/FilterCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />
</p>

#### Implementation of ClientContainsKeywordPredicate

See the above description in `Search Clients`.

### 4.5 Sort Clients

#### Description

LeadsForce allows the user to `sort` clients according to client fields. LeadsForce give clients the option to sort it in ascending or descending order.

#### Implementation
1. The `LogicManager` starts to parse the given input text using `AddressBookParser`
2. The `AddressBookParser` invokes the respective `Parser` based on the first word of the input text.
3. The remaining input text will be passed to the `SortCommandParser` to parse.
4. The `SortCommandParser` will tokenize the remaining input text using the `ArgumentTokenizer` into an `ArgumentMultiMap`.
5. The `SortCommandParser` will then create a new `SortByAttribute` based off the parsed field with the corresponding `SortDirection` using the `ArgumentMultiMap`.
6. The `SortCommandParser` will then create a `SortCommand` with the `SortByAttribute`
7. The `LogicManger` will call the execute method of `SortCommand`.
8. The `SortCommand` wil then call the `sortFilteredClientList` method of the provided `Model` with it‚Äôs `SortByAttribute`.
9. The `SortCommand` will finally create a new `CommandResult` which will be returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/tracing/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />
</p>

### 4.6 Multiple Address Book

LeadsForce allow the user to create and switch between multiple addressbook.

#### Description
LeadsForce allow the user to create and switch between multiple addressbook.

#### Implementation
Each individual addressbook is stored as its own JSON file in the data folder that the LeadsForce jar file is stored in.
The following implementation will omit the details prior to the respective commands' parser.
Also, details with regard to AddressBookList has been omitted for simplicity if it is not critical to the function of the command.

#### 4.6.1 Create new Address Book

1. The `AbCreateCommandParser` parse the name of the address book that is to be created into a `Path` to that new address book.
2. The `AbCreateCommandParser` will then create a new `AbCreateCommand` with the parsed `Path`.
3. The `LogicManger` then call the execute method of `AbCreateCommand` which set the address book `Path` and create a new `CommandResult` with the `SpecialCommandResult` type of `CREATE_ADDRESSBOOK`.
4. The `MainWindow` will then call its handleCreateAddressBook method after checking that the `CommandResult` is of type `CREATE_ADDRESSBOOK` which will call the createAddressBook method of `LogicManager`.
5. The `LogicManger` will retrieve the `Path` of the new address book and create a new `AddressBookStorage` with it and along with a new `AddressBook`.
6. The `LogicManger` then call setAddressBook method of `ModelManager` with the new `AddressBook` which will reset the `AddressBook` to a new `AddressBook`.
7. The `LogicManger` will also call switchAddressBook method of `StorageManager` with the new `AddressBookStorage`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the ab create operation works:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/AbCreateCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />
</p>

#### 4.6.2 Switch Address Book

1. The `AbSwitchCommandParser` parse the name of the address book that is to be switched to into a `Path` to that address book.
2. The `AbSwitchCommandParser` will then create a new `AbSwitchCommand` with the parsed `Path`.
3. The `LogicManger` then call the execute method of `AbSwitchCommand` which set the address book `Path` and create a new `CommandResult` with the `SpecialCommandResult` type of `SWITCH_ADDRESSBOOK`.
4. The `MainWindow` will then call its handleSwitchAddressBook method after checking that the `CommandResult` is of type `SWITCH_ADDRESSBOOK` which will call the switchAddressBook method of `LogicManager`.
5. The `LogicManger` will retrieve the `Path` of the address book to switched to and create a new `AddressBookStorage` with it
6. The `LogicManger` will also call readAddressBook method of `JsonAddressBookStorage` with the `Path` to get the `AddressBook` that is to be switched to.
7. The `LogicManger` then call setAddressBook method of `ModelManager` with the `AddressBook` which will reset the current `AddressBook` to that.
8. The `LogicManger` will also call switchAddressBook method of `StorageManager` with the new `AddressBookStorage`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/AbSwitchCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />
</p>

#### 4.6.3 Delete Address Book

1. The `AbDeleteCommandParser` parse the name of the address book that is to be deleted to into a `Path` to that address book.
2. The `AbDeleteCommandParser` will then create a new `AbDeleteCommand` with the parsed `Path`.
3. The `LogicManger` then call the execute method of `AbDeleteCommand`.
4. The `AbDeleteCommand` will then attempt to delete the address book specified by the `Path`
5. The `AbDeleteCommand` will finally create a new `CommandResult` which will be returned to `LogicManger`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/AbDeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />
</p>

#### 4.6.4 List Address Book

1. The `AbListCommand` will call getAddressBookListString method of `ModelManager`.
2. The `ModelManager` will then subsequently call toString method of `AddressBookList`
3. The `AddressBookList` will append the name of all the addressbook in its list together and return it back to `AblistCommand`
4. The `AblistCommand` will finally then create a `CommandResult` with that String and return it to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/AbListCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />
</p>

### 4.7 GUI Feature 
We will use this section to document implementation details regarding GUI-related features. 

#### 4.7.1 Filter tag panel
Filter tag panel involves the use of a listener to watch for any changes in the `UniqueTagList`. Once a change 
is detected, it will update the UI accordingly. The tricky part is to get `UniqueTagList` to work with the `TagPanel`
listener. We also have to constantly monitor the "reference states" of `Tag` items in the `UniqueTagList` so that tags panel automatically removes 
tags that are no longer referenced by any clients. For this, some form of garbage collection mechanism must exist.

Below, we will see how creating and modifying the client have an effect on the `UniqueTagList`. Client modification can be 
seen as the entry point that triggers the chain of tag modification operations and thus the UI update of the `TagPanel`.

##### 4.7.1.1 Add a new client
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add command:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/AddUserTagActivityDiagram.png" width="320" />
</p>

###### Doubly link client and tags
Doubly linking client and tags allows us to monitor the "reference states" of the tags without iterating through the `UniqueClientList`. "Reference state" here refers to the state of being referenced as well as how many clients are currently "referencing" the tags. 

##### 4.7.1.2 Edit a client
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an edit command:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/EditUserTagActivityDiagram.png" width="320" />
</p>

###### How unreferenced tags are "garbage collected"?
The garbage collection of unreferenced tags takes place whenever the `AddressBook` listener detects an update event in the `UniqueClientList`. 
The garbage collector will iterate through the `UniqueTagList` and remove all `Tag` objects that are not referenced by any clients. The design choice of doubly linking the tag and client further help facilitate this process since the "reference state" of the `Tag` has become easily available as a result.

##### 4.7.1.3 Delete a client
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete command:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/DeleteUserTagActivityDiagram.png" width="320" />
</p>

###### Remove vs "Delete"
You might notice that there is an interchanging of the words Remove and Delete which seem to suggest the same thing. However, they do have some slight difference in connotations.<br>
* Remove: removal of `Client` from `UniqueClientList`.
* Delete: removal of all lingering references that this `Client` has.

The "Delete" operation should be invoked everytime you remove a `Client` from the `UniqueClientList` to ensure the correctness of the "reference state" of `Tag`. 
This is because removal of a `Client` from the `UniqueClientList` connotes that the `Client` is no longer present, hence it is important to ensure that any lingering references including association with any previously associated `Tag` objects are cut.

### 5.1 Extensions and customisations
In LeadsForce, we put a strong emphasis on ensuring not only the quality but also the extensibility and customizability of our product.
If you are wondering about how you can easily customise or add extensions to LeadsForce without worrying about the underlying implementations,
you are at the right place.
This section details the workflows and features that we have developed that can help you tweak certain features
in LeadsForce without the need for you to delve too deeply into the codebase.

#### 5.1.1 Change the look of an existing theme
Let's say you dislike the look of our current `BookTheme`: you want the background to be dark brown instead of the current light brown.
Here's what you should do:
1. cd to `tp/src/main/resources/view`.
2. Open `BookTheme.css`.
3. On the top of the css file, you will see that all the [css variables](#5111-summary-of-the-functions-of-css-variables) are nicely organised and defined for you. 
4. Let's change the value of `-fx-base-1` to `#5C4033` instead (the color code for dark brown).
5. Save the file and boot up LeadsForce. You will see that the change in the background color of `BookTheme` is reflected immediately.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/BookThemeModified.png" width="500" />
</p>

##### 5.1.1.1 Summary of the functions of CSS variables:

CSS Variable | Description | Default (in BookTheme)
--------|---------|---------
-fx-base1 | Base color 1 <br>‚Ä¢ Preferably the darkest tone.<br>‚Ä¢ Used as the main background color of LeadsForce. | #cb997e
-fx-base2 | Base color 2 | #eddcd2
-fx-base3 | Base color 3 | #fff1e6
-fx-base4 | Base color 4 | #f0efeb
-fx-base5 | Base color 5 <br>‚Ä¢ Preferably the lightest tone. | #ddbea9
-fx-font-color | The color of a generic font in LeadsForce | derive(-fx-base1, -30%)
-fx-font-color-bright | The color of a "bright" font in LeadsForce <br>‚Ä¢ "Bright" fonts overlay components of base color 1. | #ffffff
-fx-menu-color | Color of the menu | #263238
-fx-menu-color-highlighted | Color of the menu when highlighted | #455a64
-fx-menu-font-color | Color of the menu font | #ffffff
-fx-menu-font-color-highlighted | Color of the menu font when highlighted | #ffffff

#### 5.1.2 Give LeadsForce a new theme
If you want to add more themes on top of our existing themes, here's what you should do:
1. cd to `tp/src/main/resources/view`.
2. Create a copy of `BookTheme.css`.
3. Rename the file to you preferred theme name and open it. e.g. `RainbowTheme.css`.
4. Similar to 5.1.1, tweak the css variables to suit your needs.
5. Save the file and cd to `tp/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/ThemeList.java`.
6. Add `RainbowTheme.css` to the static variable `THEMES` like so:<br>
````
List.of(..., "RainbowTheme");
````
7. Now boot up LeadsForce and you should see that your newly added theme is available in the menu bar. Hooray!
