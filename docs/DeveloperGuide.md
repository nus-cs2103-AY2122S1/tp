### Architecture

<center>
    <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of Source Control.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sourcecontrol/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sourcecontrol/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of Source Control consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of Source Control in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user executes the command `delete 1`.

<center>
    <img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<center>
    <img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" />
</center>
<br>

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sourcecontrol/ui/Ui.java)

<center>
    <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>


The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sourcecontrol/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sourcecontrol/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<center>
    <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SourceControlParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g. `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Activity Diagram below illustrates how user input is parsed by the `Logic` component.

<center>
    <img src="images/ParseActivityDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

<center>
    <img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<center>
    <img src="images/ParserClasses.png" />
</center>
<br>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SourceControlParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SourceControlParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sourcecontrol/model/Model.java)


<center>
    <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>


The `Model` component,

* stores the application data i.e. all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g. results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `SourceControl`, which `Student` references. This allows `SourceControl` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects. Note that other classes such as `Group` and `Assessment` are omitted here for brevity.<br>

<center>
    <img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" />
</center>

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/sourcecontrol/storage/Storage.java)

<center>
    <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both application data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `SourceControlStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.sourcecontrol.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a student

The `addstudent` feature adds a student with the provided name and NUSNET ID into the database. If the student comes with optionally specified groups and tags, these fields will be added accordingly.

#### How the `addstudent` command works

1. The user specifies the student name, NUSNET ID, and if applicable, the groups and tags belonging to the student.
2. If the name or NUSNET ID is not provided, the user will be prompted to enter them via an error message.
3. The ID is cross-referenced with the current students in the database, and an error is thrown if the student to add has the same ID as a pre-existing student.
4. If the student to add has a unique NUSNET ID, the groups, if provided, will be parsed individually.
    * If the provided group exists, the student will be added into that group.
    * If the provided group does not exist, a new group will be added, and the student will be added into that group subsequently.
5. A new `Student` object is created with the given name, NUSNET ID, groups, and tags, which is then added into the database.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `addstudent` command to add a new student. In the case where the student is not added, an error message will be displayed with the reason.

<center>
    <img src="images/AddStudentActivityDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when the user inputs an `addstudent` command together with the name and NUSNET ID of the student to be added.

<br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddStudentCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram. This is also applicable to other sequence diagrams in this guide.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Creating a new group

The `addgroup` feature allows users to create new groups, as well as specify students to be added to the group to be created.

#### How the `addgroup` command works

1. The user specifies the group name, as well as a list of names and/or IDs of the students to be added into the group.
2. For each of the names and IDs, an `AllocDescriptor` is created.
3. For each of the `AllocDescriptors`, a search is done against the current `StudentList` to find students that match the descriptors.
   * If there is one and only one match, the student is added to the group.
4. The group is added to the application if Step 3 completes without any exceptions.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** In the case where there are more than one students matched because they share the same name, an error message will be displayed to the user. The user will then have to specify the student to be added using his/her NUSNET ID.
</div>

</center>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a student into a group

The `addalloc` feature allows users to allocate a student into a group.

#### How the `addalloc` command works

1. The user specifies the group name, and the name or ID of the student to be allocated into the group.
2. An `AllocDescriptor` containing info of the group and the student is created.
3. The `AllocDescriptor` is used to find the group and the student(s) as specified.
   * If there is only one matched student, the student is added to the group.
   * If there are multiple matched students, the allocation is not made successfully, and the student list is updated with all matched students.
4. The student is allocated into the group.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** In the case where there are more than one students matched because they share the same name, an error message will be displayed to the user. The user will then have to specify the student to be added using his/her NUSNET ID.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a score

The `addscore` feature allows users to add score for an assessment of a student.

#### How the `addscore` command works

1. The user specifies the assessment name, the name or ID of the student, and the score to be added.
2. An `ScoreDescriptor` containing info of the group, the student and the score is created.
3. The `ScoreDescriptor` is used to find the assessment and the student(s) as specified.
   * If there is only one matched student, the assessment of the student will be updated with the new score.
   * If there are multiple matched students, the update is not made successfully, and the student list is updated with all matched students.
4. The score is updated in the assessment of the student.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** In the case where there are more than one students matched because they share the same name, an error message will be displayed to the user. The user will then have to specify the student to be added using his/her NUSNET ID.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `addscore` command to add score for an assessment of a student. In the case where the score is not added/updated, an error message will be displayed with the reason.

<br>
<center>
    <img src="images/AddScoreToModelSequenceDiagram.png" />
</center>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Searching for students

The `search` feature allows user to filter student list by name, NUSNET ID, groups, or tags.

#### How the `search` command works

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when the user inputs an `search` command together with a name to be searched for.

<center>
    <img src="images/SearchSequenceDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>

A `Predicate<Student>` object will be created for each search command.
It contains `test(Student student)` function which checks if the given student matches the list of keywords given.

To support the differentiated search functionality for different flags (e.g. name, NUSNET ID, group name, or tag),
multiple classes extending from `Predicate<Student>` can be created,
each with different implementation of the `test(Student student)` function.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`: checks if any word in the full name of student matches exactly any word in the
  given keywords. e.g. `Alex Yu` will match `Alex Yeoh` and `Bernice Yu`. Partial search is not supported
  e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* `IdContainsKeywordsPredicate`: checks if the ID of student contains any word in the given keywords.
  Partial search is supported. e.g. `E05` will match `E0523412`.
* `GroupContainsKeywordsPredicate`: checks if any group of student contains any word in the given keywords.
  Partial search is supported. e.g. `T02` will match `T02A` and `T02B`.
* `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`: checks if the tag of student contains any word in the given keywords.
  Partial search is supported. e.g. `beginner` will match `beginners`.

The following activity diagrams summarizes what happens when a user executes the `search` command to search for students with different filters.

<center>
    <img src="images/SearchActivityDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** SearchCommandParser checks
if the command input is valid. The command is invalid if the user input is empty, or if the user entered more or less than one flag.
</div>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Importing data

The `import` feature allows users to load data as specified in the provided CSV file.

#### How the `import` command works

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `import` command to import a CSV data file. In the case where the file is not imported, an error message will be displayed with the reason.

<center>
    <img src="images/ImportActivityDiagram.png" />
</center>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

There are several important details left out of the activity diagram for the sake of clarity:

1. The import feature is reliant on having a correctly formatted csv file (which is to be exported from sites like LumiNUS and Source Academy, and modified to fit the format).
   The user needs to provide the number of `Groups`, `Assessments`, and `Tags` since we can't detect this automatically from the format of the file. The proper format of the file can be found in the user guide.

1. A `CommandException` will be thrown if any input does not follow the formatting specified in the respective classes such as `Name`, `ID`, and `Score`.

1. When reading a student's groups, the command will try to use an existing `Group` if possible, to ensure that the `Group` holds a reference to all `Students` in the group. A new `Group` will only be created in the case where the group hasn't already been created.

1. When reading a student's scores, the command will add the score to the `Student`, as well as the `Assessment` created from reading the first row.

1. Columns can be empty, except for the assessment name columns in the header row, and the name and ID columns of each student. Empty columns are assumed to be missing data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Showing assessment result analysis

The `show` feature allows users to show the performance analysis of a student, a group or the cohort in an assessment.

#### How the `show` command works

1. The user specifies the student (by either name, ID or index), the group name or the assessment name.
2. An `ScoreDescriptor` containing info of the group, the student and the score is created.
3. The `ScoreDescriptor` is used to find the assessment and the student(s) as specified.
   * If there is only one matched student, the assessment of the student will be updated with the new score.
   * If there are multiple matched students, the update is not made successfully, and the student list is updated with all matched students.
4. The performance analysis of the student, the group or the cohort in an assessment is displayed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** In the case where the performance analysis of a student is requested by identity and there are more than one students matched because they share the same name, an error message will be displayed to the user. The user will then have to specify the student to be added using his/her NUSNET ID.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Setting customized aliases for commands

The `alias` feature allows users to define their own aliases for commands. This is useful to shorten the input for commands that the user uses often. 

An alias is basically just a mapping of a user-provided string to a command word. It works by directly replacing the first word in the user's input command with the alias word, then parsing again.
An alias contains two strings: An `aliasWord` which is the new user-defined word, and a `commandWord` which is the command word of an existing default command (e.g. `addstudent`, `clear`, `exit`).

#### How the `alias` command works

Parsing of an alias command follows the following steps:
1. The alias word is checked to ensure that it is one word long.
1. The alias word is also checked to ensure that it does not overlap with any default command word. This is to prevent the re-mapping of any default command words and potentially losing the functionality of the application.
1. The command word is checked for validity by attempting to parse the command word. If the parser does not recognize the command word, it is not valid.
1. If the command word is an alias, it is replaced with the command word that the alias maps to.
1. The new `Alias` and `AliasCommand` is created, and executed.
1. The alias is added to both the parser, and the model (so that it can be saved in the `UserPrefs`)
    * If the alias word is already present in the parser, the command word it is mapped to is replaced with the new command word instead.
    * If the alias word and the command word are identical, it is assumed that the user is trying to delete an existing alias. The existing alias is removed instead.
    
If the command word of any future user input matches the alias, the first word of the user input will be replaced by the command word of the alias.
The activity diagram of how a command is parsed can be found in the [Logic section of this guide](#logic-component).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect 1: How aliases are stored and parsed**

There were two ideas on how this could be done:
1. Store the command's `Parser` in each alias. The parser attribute of the alias can then be retrieved and `Parser::execute` can be called when parsing.
    * Pros:
        * Very elegant and streamlined parsing. Almost no changes need to be made to the logic of `SourceControlParser`.
    * Cons:
        * It is not easy to obtain the type of `Parser` simply through the command word provided by the user given the current implementation of the project. You'd need to iterate through all possible `Commands`, and match their command word with the provided word. This approach would not be very extensible if more commands are to be added in the future. 
        * It is also not easy to save/load the alias to/from the `UserPrefs`. The best approach is likely to just save the command word, then generate the `Parser` when loading. However, this poses a similar problem as the previous point, which is that it is not easy to generate the `Parser` just from the command word.
1. Store the command word in each alias. Replace the command word of the user input if the user inputs an aliased command, and parse it again.
    * Pros:
        * Very easy to store. Each alias is essentially just two strings.
    * Cons: 
        * Have to be careful with the implementation to prevent any edge cases where the user can define aliases to create an infinite loop.
    
We decided to go with the easier implementation of storing each alias as two strings. However, there were still more aspects to be considered.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Aspect 2: How to handle aliases of aliases**

That is, what happens when the user does `alias -c <existing_alias> -as <new_alias>`? There are two choices for this: 
1. The new alias maps to the existing alias word directly.
    * The command word stored in the new `Alias` would be the alias word of the existing `Alias`.
    * Assuming that an alias `ag` already exists for `addgroup`, the following commands have the following effects:
        * `alias -c ag -as addg` would make `addg` map to `ag`, which is in turn mapped to `addgroup`. When parsing, `addg` will be replaced with `ag`, which is then replaced by `addgroup`.
        * `alias -c addalloc -as ag` would make `ag` map to `addalloc`. `addg` would also then map to `addalloc`, since it gets replaced by `ag` when parsing, which then gets replaced by `addalloc`.
    * Pros:
        * Intuitive approach to aliases: "I want `addg` to mean `ag`".
    * Cons:
        * Possible to make parsing a very expensive task due to having to replace the command word and parsing multiple times.
        * Possible to have an infinite loop by mapping two aliases to each other.
        * It's not very useful to have two aliases always mean the same thing.
2. The new alias maps to the command word that the existing alias maps to.
    * The command word stored in the new `Alias` would be the command word of the existing `Alias`.
    * Assuming that an alias `ag` already exists for `addgroup`, the following commands have the following effects:
        * `alias -c ag -as addg` would make `addg` map to `addgroup` directly.
        * `alias -c addalloc -as ag` would make `ag` map to `addalloc`. `addg` would still map to `addgroup`.
    * Pros:
        * Naturally prevents the creation of infinite loops.
        * Parsing is guaranteed to only take one recursive call to the `parse` method.
    * Cons: 
        * It is a less intuitive approach to aliases: "I want `addg` to mean what `ag` means at the current moment"
    
We decided to go with implementation 2 due to its ability to naturally handle infinite loops and better performance. Our target audience is also Computer Science professors, who should be very familiar with this style of referencing, since that is exactly how names refer to primitive values in programming.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Aspect 3: Removing aliases**

We believe that there needs to be a way to remove aliases. Otherwise, there will eventually be a very large amount of aliases, and some typo might lead to executing a command you didn't intend to execute. Hopefully, that command isn't `clear`.

Again, there are two choices we could take:
1. Make a new command for removing an alias, e.g. `removealias`.
    * Pros:
        * Intuitive to know what the new command does from its command word.
    * Cons:
        * Might end up having too many commands for a less prominent function like aliasing.
        * Takes a little more effort to implement.
2. Modify the existing `alias` command to accept a special case to remove aliases.
    * More specifically, `alias -c <existing_alias> -as <same_alias>` will remove the alias.
    * Pros:
        * Easy to implement: Just check if alias word and command word are the same.
        * One command for the whole alias functionality.
    * Cons:
        * Not particularly intuitive. The `alias` command feels like a command to use for adding aliases, but it is being used to remove one instead.
    
We ended up going with the second approach since the alias functionality was a very small part of the application. We also believe that it does make sense that mapping an alias to itself would remove it.

Furthermore, removing aliases is likely a very rare use case, and dedicating a whole command to it does feel like a bit of a waste.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile:**

Targets professors of CS1101S who:
* has a need to manage a significant number of students
* has a need to analyse students' performance
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition:** This app will help CS1101S professors keep track of students' performance after each assessment,
doing so faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

## **Appendix: Effort**

In general, we believe that we have put in a lot of effort for this project. We managed to implement the target features we originally set out to do, plus a few extra nice-to-have features.

We also managed to keep the code coverage reasonably high at 76%, and there was only a small set of unique bugs found in the PE-D.

### Challenges faced

The following features were relatively hard to implement:
1. JavaFX Charts are a part of the JavaFX library which we had to learn how to use from scratch. However, it was an essential part of our goals for the application.
    * It was not easy to customize the chart styles (such as the colour scheme) to fit with the overall design of the application.
    * Many things about the format of the charts were difficult to customize, such as the direction and layout of axis labels.

1. Aliases were deceptively hard to implement, and took more time than expected.
    * Even though Jonas implemented an alias feature for his iP, the implementation had to be completely different since the parser was using a completely different design.
    * Many aspects had to be considered and carefully weighed. You can read more about it in the [alias section of this guide](#alias-feature).
    
1. Adapting the AB3 code to fit into the context of Source Control.
    * While adding and removing classes wasn't too bad, adapting the tests was on a whole new level.
    * There were a lot of tests that we didn't want to delete, and instead chose to adapt them as well. 
      This proved to be highly time-consuming, since you had to read through the test code and completely understand what it was doing in order to properly adapt it.
    * Our application has three different classes (`Student`, `Assessment`, `Group`) that are highly coupled to each other. AB3 did not have such problems as it only contained one `Person` class. 
      It was difficult to ensure that our objects are sharing information with each other properly, while trying to keep the level of coupling as low as possible. This coupling also proved to be the source of several hard-to-find bugs. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Features scrapped

The following features were scrapped due to the high difficulty or error-prone nature of their implementations.
1. Allowing the user to specify their file path to export data or graphs
    * From the feedback received from the PE-D, we realized how easy it was to exploit the ability to specify your file path through user input.
    * One problem was how different OSes handled file paths. Some paths were valid only on some OSes, and checking the user input was non-trivial.
    * Java's `Path` and `File` felt insufficient to properly check all possible user inputs for validity. Through testing, it seemed like some invalid file names were still leaking through any checks we had implemented.
    * These problems were discovered too late to settle with a good, bug-free solution. As such, we decided to drop the ability for users to specify files to write to.
    * While one solution was to use the `FileChooser` class from JavaFX, that would violate the requirements of the application being CLI-based. 
    
2. Commands longer than one word in length
    * Initially, `addstudent` was `add student` (the same goes for other similar commands in the `add` family). This required some minor tweaking of the parser which was relatively straightforward.
    * However, when it came to implementing aliases, we realized that it was difficult to ensure that the aliases don't overlap with the multi-worded commands without drastically changing the parser.
    * Thankfully, the simple solution was to just enforce everything to be one word long.

3. Allowing non-alphanumeric characters in student names
    * As Source Control stores the official names of students, we had to consider that these names could contain non-alphanumeric characters, such as "Mary-Ann Tan". This is in contrast with AB3, where names of contacts do not need to be official names and these non-alphanumeric characters can be left out.
    * However, allowing non-alphanumeric characters in student names would lead to problems such as not being able to identify invalid names like "@@@". It also leads to complications with parsing, for example when "-g" is meant to be part of the student name but would be parsed as an argument.
    * As such, given the time constraint, we decided to maintain the original functionality of AB3, and only allow alphanumeric characters.
