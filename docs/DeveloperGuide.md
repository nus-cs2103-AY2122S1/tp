### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/insurancepal/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/insurancepal/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/insurancepal/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/insurancepal/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/insurancepal/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `InsurancePalParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InsurancePalParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `InsurancePalParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/insurancepal/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `InsurancePal`, which `Person` references. This allows `InsurancePal` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/insurancepal/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both clients' data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InsurancePalStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.insurancepal.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

###  Revenue feature

#### Current Implementation
{:.no_toc}

A client's revenue is currently represented by the `revenue` field under `Person`,
which is represented by a `Revenue` object.

The `Revenue` object contains a `Money` field called `value` which represents the amount 
of money in Singapore Dollars(SGD) that the user earned from the client. This `value` can 
never be null.

<img src="images/RevenueClassDiagram.png" width="300" />

The processing of a revenue command from the user can be split into 2 general steps:
1. Parsing the user input into a `RevenueCommand`
2. Executing the `RevenueCommand`

Each step will be described in the sections below.

**Step 1**: Parsing of user input

Parsing of the user input is primarily handled by the `RevenueCommandParser` which calls other
helper classes to parse the text into the data classes `Index` and `Revenue`.

<img src="images/RevenueCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

`RevenueCommandParser` then creates a `RevenueCommand` using the `Index` and `Revenue` objects created.

**Step 2**: Executing the RevenueCommand

<img src="images/RevenueCommandExecuteActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

There are 2 possible outcomes from the execution of a RevenueCommand.

1. Add a new revenue to the client
2. No changes to the client's revenue after a RevenueCommand as the total value of
the new revenue and client's original revenue is negative

#### Design considerations
{:.no_toc}

*Aspect*: User interface of adding and editing revenue.

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** `revenue` command adds to existing `revenue`
of client. `edit` command sets the `revenue` of client.
  * Pros: Easier to implement
  * Cons: User has to remember a lot of commands and to also understand the differences
  between each command
* **Alternative 2:** One `revenue` command adds and edits
  * Pros: Fewer commands for the user to remember
  * Cons: It will be difficult to give proper error messages since we are not sure
  of the user's intentions
### Add command

A user can use the add command to add a clients. A sequence diagram of this action is as shown:

![AddCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


###  Note feature

#### Current Implementation
{:.no_toc}

A client's note is currently represented by the `note` field under `Person`,
which is represented by an `Note` object.

The `Note` object contains a `value` field that has the type `String`, the `value` field is the description of the note given to a `Person`.

<img src="images/NoteClassDiagram.png" width="300" />

A `Note` can be given to a `Person` through any of these 3 methods:

1. Using the `NoteCommand` to add a note to an existing `Person`.
2. Through the `AddCommand`, a new `Person` with a `Note` can be created.
3. Editing a `Person` using the `EditCommand` to give the `Person` a `Note`.

The processing of a note command from the user can be split into 2 general steps:

1. Parsing the user input into a `NoteCommand`
2. Executing the `NoteCommand`
   Each step will be described in the sections below.

**Step 1:** Parsing of user input

The user input is parsed by the `NoteCommandParser` which calls other helper methods 
to parse the text into a `Note` object

<img src="images/NoteCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

The `NoteCommandParser` uses the parsed data classes to create a `NoteCommand`. Unlike the `Claim` feature, as the `Note` command has no constraints on the text that can be inputted, the `NoteCommandParser` is able to create a `NoteCommand` without using a `EditNoteDescriptor.

**Step 2:** Executing the NoteCommand

<img src="images/NoteCommandExecuteActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

There are 3 possible outcomes from the execution of a `NoteCommand`.

1. Add a new Note to the client
2. Edit an existing Note of the client
3. Delete an existing Note of the client

#### Design considerations
{:.no_toc}

*Aspect*: User interface of adding, editing and deleting Note

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** The 'Note' command and 'Edit' command adds, edits and deletes. The 'Add' command is also able to create a person with a note.
    * Pros:
        * It is more intuitive as the note is a field that belongs to a `Person`.
        * The user has more flexibility when choosing how to add, edit or delete a note.
    * Cons:
        * It is difficult to give proper error messages since we are not sure of the user intentions
        * The user has to keep track of more prefixes
        * The "help message" for the 'Add' and 'Edit' commands become longer and harder to read due to the additional field.
* **Alternative 2:** One ‘Note’ command adds, edits and deletes
    * Pros: Fewer commands for the user to remember
    * Cons: It is difficult to give proper error messages since we are not sure of the user intentions
* **Alternative 3:** Different commands for add, edit and delete
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: User has to remember a lot of commands

###  Claims feature

#### Current Implementation
{:.no_toc}

The processing of a claim command from the user can be split into 2 general steps:
1. Parsing the user input into a `ClaimCommand`
2. Executing the `ClaimCommand`
Each step will be described in the sections below.

**Step 1:** Parsing of user input

Parsing of the user input is primarily handled by the `ClaimCommandParser` which calls other helper classes to
parse the text into the data classes `Title`, `Description` and `Status`

<img src="images/ClaimCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

`ClaimCommandParser` uses the parsed data classes to create an `EditClaimDescriptor`. It does not create a `Claim` at
this stage because the user input could be giving an incomplete description of a `Claim` with missing fields. These
missing fields imply that the user wants to edit or delete an existing claim. The difference between a `Claim` and
`EditClaimDescriptor` can be seen in the class diagram below.

<img src="images/ClaimEditClaimDescriptorClassDiagram.png" width="300" />

**Step 2:** Executing the ClaimCommand

<img src="images/ClaimCommandExecuteActivityDiagram.png" width="500" />

There are 3 possible outcomes from the execution of a ClaimCommand (shown in blue above).
1. Add a new claim to the client
2. Edit an existing claim of the client
3. Delete an existing claim of the client

#### Design considerations
{:.no_toc}

*Aspect*: User interface of adding, editing and deleting claims

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** One ‘claim’ command adds, edits and deletes
    * Pros: Fewer commands for the user to remember
    * Cons: It is difficult to give proper error messages since we are not sure of the user intentions
* **Alternative 2:** Different commands for add, edit and delete
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: User has to remember a lot of commands
    
#### Future Improvements
{:.no_toc}

* A Java HashSet may not be the most appropriate data structure to store claims since it is unable to find a claim
  in O(1) time. Instead, a HashMap may be more appropriate, using the claim title as key.
* Currently, there is no relationship between Claim and EditClaimDescriptor. This means that any future changes
  to Claim would need a corresponding change to EditClaimDescriptor. Instead, Claim and EditClaimDescriptor should
  both extend from an abstract class to ensure that any future modification would not lead to regressions.

###  Schedule appointment feature

#### Current Implementation
{:.no_toc}

An appointment with a client is currently represented by the `appointment` field under `Person`,
which is represented by an `Appointment` object.

The `Appointment` object contains a `LocalDateTime` field called `appointmentTime` which represents the time that
the appointment with is scheduled for. An empty appointment is represented when `appointmentTime` is set to `null`.

<img src="images/ScheduleAppointmentClassDiagram.png" width="300" />

The processing of a schedule command from the user can be split into 2 general steps:
1. Parsing the user input into a `ScheduleCommand`
2. Executing the `ScheduleCommand`

Each step will be described in the sections below.

**Step 1:** Parsing of user input

Parsing of the user input is primarily handled by the `ScheduleCommandParser` which calls other helper classes to
parse the text into the data classes `Index` and `Appointment`.

<img src="images/ScheduleCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

During this process, the Appointment object is being created using the user input.
Depending on the input, there are 2 possible outcomes:
1. A valid appointment containing a meeting time is created.
2. An empty appointment is created. This happens when the user input for `m/` is an empty string.

This process is illustrated by this diagram:

<img src="images/AppointmentConstructorActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

`ScheduleCommandParser` then creates a `ScheduleCommand` using the `Index` and `Appointment` objects created.

**Step 2:** Executing the ScheduleCommand

<img src="images/ScheduleCommandExecuteActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

There are 4 possible outcomes from the execution of a ScheduleCommand.
1. Schedule a new appointment with the client
2. Reschedule an appointment with the client
3. Delete an existing appointment with the client
4. Do nothing.

#### Design considerations
{:.no_toc}
* Appointments with expired dates are not automatically deleted and scheduling appointments that are expired are permitted. This is because the user might want to check how long it has since they met a specific client.

*Aspect*: User interface of adding, editing and deleting appointments

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** One ‘schedule’ command adds, edits and deletes
    * Pros: Fewer commands for the user to remember
    * Cons: It is difficult to give proper error messages since we are not sure of the user intentions
* **Alternative 2:** Different commands for add, edit and delete
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: User has to remember a lot of commands
    
### Insurance feature

#### Implementation
{:.no_toc}

`Insurance` is currently composed of two objects:

* `InsuranceType`, which is a `Enum` of types `Life`, `Health`, and `General`.
* `brand`, a `String` representing the brand of insurance.

A `Person` can have any number of different `Insurances`, stored as a `HashSet`.

`Insurance` can be added to a `Person` through the `add` command, and edited through the `edit` command.

A class diagram of `Insurance` is as shown:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* works as an insurance agent
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* has a need to manage a large number of his/her Singaporean clients and their details
* has a need to be reminded about his/her meeting timings with clients
* has a need to manage revenue and costs for his clients

**Value proposition**: manage clients faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app and to also be able
to collate details of clients in one application.
