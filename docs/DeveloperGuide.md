:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder.

### Architecture
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/dg-diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

</div>


### Storage component
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The `add` command is facilitated by creating an `AddCommand` depending on the given input.
This command then updates the `model` accordingly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an ```add``` command:
![images](images/dg-diagrams/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** There should only be one arrowhead at the end of every line 
in the Activity Diagram. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add operation behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid command `add n/Dylan p/97998581 e/dylan.eyyou@gmail.com r/Pilot et/Full time s/3500 l/PhD y/4`
is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse
the input into command word `add` and command argument ``` n/Dylan p/97998581 e/dylan.eyyou@gmail.com r/Pilot et/Full time s/3500 l/PhD y/4```.

Step 2. `AddCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `AddCommandParser#parse()` is called.
`AddCommandParser#parse()` then calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to obtain an `ArgumentMultimap`, which is
a mapping of all prefixes to their respective arguments (i.e. `n/` to `Dylan`, `p/` to `97998581`, etc). 

Step 3. `AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent` is then called to ensure all the mandatory prefixes have been inputted by the user.
After which, `AddCommandParser#parse()` then initializes a new `Person` with all the specified details from the input.

Step 4. `AddCommandParser#parse()` then initializes an `AddCommand` with the new `Person` as an argument. `AddCommand#execute()` 
is then called, which calls `Model#hasPerson()` to ensure that the new `Person` is not a duplicate of any existing applicant in the 
`AddressBook`.

Step 5. `AddCommand#execute()` then calls `Model#addPerson()` to add the new applicant in the `AddressBook`.

Step 6. `CommandResult` is initialized with `String` containing the details of the new applicant.
This `CommandResult` is then returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works.
![images](images/dg-diagrams/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

### Edit feature
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The ```edit``` command is facilitated by creating an ```EditCommand``` depending on the given input.
This command then updates the ```model``` accordingly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an ```edit``` command:
![images](images/dg-diagrams/EditCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** There should only be one arrowhead at the end of every line 
in the Activity Diagram. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit operation behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid command `edit 1 n/Ali` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `edit 1 n/Ali` into command word `edit` and command argument ``` 1 n/Ali```.

Step 2. `EditCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `EditCommandParser#parse()` is called.
`EditCommandParser#parse()` then calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to identify the `Index` of the person to be
edited from the preamble of the input (i.e. `1` in this case), as well as obtain an `ArgumentMultimap` of prefixes
to their respective arguments (i.e. mapping `n/` to `Ali`).

Step 3. `EditCommandParser#parse()` then initializes an `EditPersonDescriptor` that stores the details to edit the person with.
Thus, `EditPersonDescriptor#setName()` will be called to store `Ali` as the `Name` to be edited to.

Step 4. `EditCommandParser#parse()` then initializes an `EditCommand` with the `Index` and `EditPersonDescriptor` as an argument.
`EditCommand#execute()` is then called, which creates a new `Person` and copies over the details to be edited
from the `EditPersonDescriptor`.

Step 5. After checking that the new `Person` is not a duplicate of any existing applicant in the `AddressBook` using `Model#hasPerson()`,
`Model#setPerson()` will be called to change the specified applicant in the `AddressBook`. Finally, `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`
is called to reflect the changes in the list of applicants shown to the user.

Step 6. Once the list is updated, `CommandResult` is initialized with `String` containing the details of the edited applicants.
This `CommandResult` is then returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works.
![images](images/dg-diagrams/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

### Delete feature
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The ```delete``` command is facilitated by creating a ```DeleteCommand``` depending on the given input.
This command then updates the ```model``` accordingly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an ```delete``` command:
![images](images/dg-diagrams/DeleteActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** There should only be one arrowhead at the end of every line 
in the Activity Diagram. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario illustrated by a sequence diagram for ```delete``` command.

Step 1. A valid command `delete 1` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `delete 1` into command word `delete` and command argument ``` 1```.

Step 2. `DeleteCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `DeleteCommandParser#parse()` is called
to identify the indices present in ``` 1```. `DeleteCommandParser#parse()` then initializes a
`DeleteCommand` with the indices present as arguments.

Step 3. `DeleteCommand#execute()` is then called, which will check the validity of the given indices. 
If there is no exception thrown, `Model#deletePerson()` is called to delete the applicants corresponding to the 
given indices.

Step 4. `CommandResult` is initialized with `String` containing the details of the deleted applicant.
This `CommandResult` is then returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works.
![images](images/dg-diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

### Find feature
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The ```find``` command is facilitated by creating a ```FindCommand``` depending on the given
input. This command then updates the ```model``` accordingly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a ```find``` command:

![images](images/dg-diagrams/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** There should only be one arrowhead at the end of every line 
in the Activity Diagram. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario illustrated by a sequence diagram for ```find``` command.

Step 1. A valid command `find n/Alex y/0` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `find n/Alex y/0` into command word `find` and command argument ``` n/Alex y/0```.

Step 2. `FindCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `FindCommandParser#parse()` is called
to identify the predicates present in ` n/Alex y/0`. `FindCommandParser#parse()` then initializes a
`FindCommand` with the predicates as argument.

Step 3. `FindCommand#execute()` is then called, which will in turn call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`
and filters for applicants that have `Alex` in their names and `0` year of experience.

Step 4. Once the string of all applicant names is formed, `CommandResult` is initialized with this string as argument
and returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works.
![images](images/dg-diagrams/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

#### Design considerations for find:
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

**Aspect: Finding by each prefix:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement different finding conditions for different prefixes. 
  * For example: 
    * ***Role***: An applicant can be matched by `role` if all parameters after `r/` are present in his `role`. 
    * ***Employment Type***:  An applicant can be matched by `employment_type` if his `employment_type` starts with any of the 
    `employment_type` parameters, and the parameter matches with an existing stored `employment_type`.
    * ***Years of Experience***: An applicant can be matched by `years_of_experience` if he has a `years_of_experience` not lesser than the `year_of_experience` parameter.
    * For detailed explanations of find parameters of each prefix, please visit the section of our [User Guide - Find Parameters](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-f11-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#find-parameters).
  * Pros: 
    Conditions to check for a match in parameters are differentiated for each prefix to allow better usability of the `find` command.
    For example, it might be more intuitive to search for a specific expected salary within a range, rather than the exact number.
  * Cons: 
    May be hard for users to remember the specifications.
* **Alternative 2 :** Use the same finding conditions for different prefixes.
  * Pros: Users do not need to remember the differences. Easier to use and not likely to cause confusions.
  * Cons: If users could not remember the stored data, they might want to search vaguely.


### Filter interview feature
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The ```filter_interview``` command is facilitated by extending an abstract ```FilterInterviewCommand``` class, and executing the appropriate
subclass depending on the given input. This command then updates the ```model``` accordingly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a ```filter_interview``` command:
![images](images/dg-diagrams/FilterInterviewCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** There should only be one arrowhead at the end of every line 
in the Activity Diagram. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter interview operation behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid command `filter_interview past` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `filter_interview past` into command word `filter_interview` and command argument ``` past```.

Step 2. `FilterInterviewCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `FilterInterviewCommandParser#parse()` is called
to identify the user input ``` past```.

Step 3. Upon identifying the user input ``` past```, `FilterInterviewCommandParser#parse` will then call methods of the
`ValidFilterInterviewArgs` class from the enum type `ValidFilterInterviewArgs.PAST` instead of `ValidFilterInterviewArgs.FUTURE`.
The details of this step are omitted from the sequence diagram below for brevity.

Step 4. `FilterInterviewCommandParser#parse` calls the method `ValidFilterInterviewArgs#getFilterInterviewCommand()` to obtain
an object of the appropriate subclass of `FilterInterviewCommand`, which in this case is an instance of `FilterInterviewPastCommand`.
This instance is returned and propagated back to `LogicManager`.

Step 5. `FilterInterviewPastCommand#execute()` is then called by `LogicManager`, which will in turn call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`
and filters for applicants that have interviews that have already passed.

Step 6. Once the list has been filtered, `CommandResult` is initialized with `String` indicating how many applicants
have interviews that have passed. This `CommandResult` is then returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter interview operation works.
![images](images/dg-diagrams/FilterInterviewCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterInterviewCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

#### Design considerations for filter interview:
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

**Aspect: User command to use in filtering interviews:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate command for filtering interviews
  * Pros: Command has single responsibility of filtering interviews based on whether they haved passed or are upcoming.
  * Pros: Easy to use for user, only has two inputs it can take.
  * Cons: Harder to implement than adding to `find` command.
  * Cons: User might be confused between `find` command for interviews and `filter_interview` command.

* **Alternative 2:** Part of `find` command functionality
  * Pros: Easy to implement
  * Pros: Intuitive for user to use `find` command to find certain types of interviews (past or future)
  * Cons: Breaks the single responsibility principle as it does not find a specific input for a prefix, but rather
    types of inputs.

### Show feature
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The ```show``` command is facilitated by creating an ```ObservableList``` of ```Person``` objects from the
```AddressBook```. A ```List``` of unique ```String``` objects is created, with ```String``` content depending on
the prefix provided by the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a ```show``` command:
![images](images/dg-diagrams/ShowCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** There should only be one arrowhead at the end of every line 
in the Activity Diagram. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the show operation behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid command `show n/` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `show n/` into command word `show` and command argument ``` n/```.

Step 2. `ShowCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `ShowCommandParser#parse()` is called
to identify the first prefix in the user input ``` n/```. `ShowCommandParser#parse()` then initializes a
`ShowCommand` with the first prefix `Name` as argument.

Step 3. `ShowCommand#execute()` is then called, which will first obtain a `ReadOnlyAddressBook` from `Model`, from which
the `ObservableList<Person>` belonging to the `ReadOnlyAddressBook` is obtained. The names of each applicant within
the `ObservableList<Person>` is then accumulated to form a string of all applicant names.

Step 4. Once the string of all applicant names is formed, `CommandResult` is initialized with this string as argument
and returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the show operation works.
![images](images/dg-diagrams/ShowCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ShowCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

#### Design considerations for show:
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

**Aspect: Finding search terms:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort unique search terms into a list.
    * Pros: List of search terms follows an order defined by us that would make it easier for the user to find the search
    term they are looking for, especially when there are a lot of search terms.
    * Pros: Testability improves as `ShowCommand#getUniqueCategoryInputs()` will return a list with 
    an order defined by us, making it easier for us to craft test cases
    * Cons: Runtime complexity will increase to `O(n log n)` rather than `O(n)` due to extra performance costs
    of sorting the search terms.

* **Alternative 2:** Not sorting unique search terms and collecting as a set.
    * Pros: Runtime complexity stays at `O(n)`. The show command will be more efficient than using **Alternative 1**.
    * Cons: List of search terms returned is in an order not defined by us, which could make it difficult for the users
    to find the search term they are looking for.
    * Cons: There is no general guarantee on the ordering of elements obtained by iterating over a set. This leads to lower
    testability as it is difficult to create test cases if the result of the method is difficult to determine.


### Mark feature
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The ```mark``` command is facilitated by creating a ```MarkCommand```, which is a subclass of ```MarkingCommand```.
This command then updates the ```model``` accordingly, depending on the given input.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a ```mark``` command:<br>
![images](images/dg-diagrams/MarkCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** There should only be one arrowhead at the end of every line 
in the Activity Diagram. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario illustrated by a sequence diagram for ```mark``` command.

Step 1. A valid command `mark 1 2` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `mark 1 2` into command word `mark` and command argument ``` 1 2```.

Step 2. `MarkingCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `MarkingCommandParser#parse()` is called
to identify the indices present in ``` 1 2```. `MarkingCommandParser#parse()` then initializes a
`MarkCommand` with the indices present as arguments.

Step 3. `MarkCommand#execute()` is then called, which will in turn call `Model#checkForMarkedPerson()` on the applicants
corresponding to the given indices. If there is no exception thrown, `Model#markPerson()` is called to mark the
applicants corresponding to the given indices.

Step 4. `CommandResult` is initialized with `String` containing the details of the newly marked applicants.
This `CommandResult` is then returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the mark operation works.

 **Note:** The lifeline for `MarkingCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

### Unmark feature
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The ```unmark``` command is facilitated by creating an ```UnmarkCommand```, which is a subclass of 
```MarkingCommand```. This command then updates the ```model``` accordingly, depending on the given input.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an ```unmark``` command:
![images](images/dg-diagrams/UnmarkCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** There should only be one arrowhead at the end of every line 
in the Activity Diagram. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario illustrated by a sequence diagram for ```unmark``` command.

Step 1. A valid command `unmark 3` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `unmark 3` into command word `unmark` and command argument ``` 3```.

Step 2. `MarkingCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `MarkingCommandParser#parse()` is called
to identify the indices present in ``` 3```. `MarkingCommandParser#parse()` then initializes a
`UnmarkCommand` with the indices present as arguments, which in this case is a single index 3.

Step 3. `UnmarkCommand#execute()` is then called, which will in turn call `Model#checkForUnmarkedPerson()` on the applicants
corresponding to the given indices. If there is no exception thrown, `Model#unmarkPerson()` is called to unmark the applicants corresponding to the given indices.

Step 4. `CommandResult` is initialized with `String` containing the details of the newly unmarked applicants.
This `CommandResult` is then returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the unmark operation works.
![images](images/dg-diagrams/UnmarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** The lifeline for `MarkingCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>

#### Design considerations for mark and unmark:
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

**Aspect: User command to use in marking and unmarking applicants:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate command for `mark` and `unmark`
  * Pros: Command has single responsibility of marking or unmarking applicants.
  * Pros: Easy and intuitive to use for user, does not take any additional input to differentiate the two commands from each other.
  * Cons: Certain amount of repeat in code for both mark and unmark commands.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement both `mark` and `unmark` as one singular command
  * Pros: Reduces code duplication in implementation.
  * Cons: Breaks the single responsibility principle as marking does a relatively different task from unmarking.

### Delete marked feature
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The ```delete_marked``` command is facilitated by creating an ```DeleteMarkedCommand```.
This command then updates the ```model``` accordingly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a ```delete_marked``` command:
![images](images/dg-diagrams/DeleteMarkedCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario illustrated by a sequence diagram for ```delete_marked``` command.

Step 1. A valid command `delete_marked` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `delete_marked`.

Step 2. `AddreddBookParser#parseCommand()` initializes a `DeleteMarkedCommand`.

Step 3. `DeleteMarkedCommand#execute()` is then called, which will in turn call `Model#updateFilteredList()` (not shown) to
update list for applicants marked then `Model#getFilteredList()` is then called to retrieve this list.

Step 4. `Model#deletePerson()` is called on applicants in the list to delete them.

Step 5. Once the string of all applicant names that are marked is formed, `CommandResult` is initialized with this string as argument
and returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete marked operation works.
![images](images/dg-diagrams/DeleteMarkedCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations for delete marked:
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

**Aspect: User command to use in deleting marked applicants:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate command for deleting marked applicants
  * Pros: Command has single responsibility of deleting marked applicants based.
  * Pros: Easy to use for user, does not take any additional input.
  * Cons: User might be confused between `delete` command for general deletion and `delete_marked` command.

* **Alternative 2:** Part of `delete` command functionality
  * Pros: Intuitive for user to use `delete` command for all deletion purposes
  * Cons: Breaks the single responsibility principle as deleting marked applicants does not delete applicants at specific indices
    like the rest of the `delete` command, but rather a certain group of applicants at once.

### Datetime for interview
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The `Interview` class accepts `yyyy-M-d, H:m` as parsed time format and provides `MMM dd yyyy , HH:mm` as display format.
- `yyyy` : year-of-era in 4 digits, e.g. `2021`
- `M` : month-of-year, e.g. `7`, `07`
- `d` : day-of-month, e.g. `10`
- `H` : hour-of-day (0-23), e.g. `0`
- `m` : minute-of-hour, e.g. `30`

`Interview#isValidInterviewTime` uses `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` to generate a formatter using `Interview#PARSE_FORMAT`,
and checks for `DateTimeParseException` when parsing the input with the formatter via `LocalDate#parse()`.

The `display()` method uses `java.text.DateFormat` and returns the formatted time which is displayed GUI.

For example, the add command `add n/John ... i/2021-01-01, 10:30` will add a person John with interview time shown as `Jan 01 2021, 10:30`.

## **Appendix A: Requirements**
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Product scope
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

**Target user profile**:
A recruiter that
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* has a need to manage a significant number of applications
* works for a company that gets applications for variety of roles
* has a need to filter and categorize applicants by different fields


**Value proposition**:

It can be hard for recruiters to keep track of the plethora of clients with different skill sets, availability
and experience.

This product will make recruitersâ€™ lives easier through categorisation and filter features to easily access candidates
they have in mind. Recruiters can manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

## **Appendix C: Effort**
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The effort required to evolve `AB3` to `RecruitIn` could be estimated to be approximately the effort required to create AB3.
Our team have contributed roughly 11000 lines of functional code, automated unit and integration testing, and documentation.
Listed below are some features and enhancements, and an explanation of the difficulty or effort required to implement them:

### Addition of categories
* `AB3` initially had the `Name`, `Phone Number`, `Email`, `Address`, and `Tag` categories.
* `RecruitIn` removed the `Address` category, and introduced the `Applied Role`, `Employment Type`, `Expected Salary`, `Level of Education`, `Years of Experience`, `Interview`, and `Notes` categories, as well as a `Done` status.
* The addition of the categories itself was relatively low effort as we were already reusing most of `AB3`'s existing categories.
* Furthermore, we did not have to make any additional design decisions and could follow the existing architecture in order to add the new categories.
    
### Integration of categories
* This includes integration of the new categories into the existing `add`, `edit` and `find` command.
* The integration of the new categories into the `add` command was done without much relative difficulty.
* The integration of the new categories into the `edit` command did involve a refactoring of the entire edit command parser, and thus required relatively more effort.
* The integration of the new categories into the `find` command was very high effort, because of the following 3 reasons:
  1. Each category was filtered by the `find` command differently, and thus involved multiple differing implementations of how to filter each category.
  2. The `find` command was improved to allow for searching of multiple categories at the same time.
  3. The `find` command was modified to validate parameters for each category.
  
### Implementation of new features
* This includes the implementation of the `show`, `mark`, `unmark`, `delete_marked`, and `filter_interview` commands.
  * The implementation of new features was generally high effort due to having to create each command from scratch.
  * Difficulties arose mostly from having to make our own design decisions, while at the same time having to following important software engineering principles and practices.
* Additionally, the `delete` command was improved to allow for deletion of multiple indexes at the same time.
  * The modification of the existing `delete` command was generally low effort and only required additions of a few lines of functional code.
