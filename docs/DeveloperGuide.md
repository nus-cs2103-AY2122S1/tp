### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/teachbook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/teachbook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/teachbook/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `ClassListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.
The `ClassCard` will be displayed by the `ClassListPanel` and the `StudentCard` will be displayed by the `StudentListPanel`. 

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/teachbook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` and `Class` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/teachbook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TeachBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TeachBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TeachBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/teachbook/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png"/>


The `Model` component,

* stores TeachBook data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/teachbook/storage/Storage.java)

![](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TeachBook data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TeachBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.teachbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Integration of class feature

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Structure of the new model component**

To integrate the new class feature into the existing AB3 product, we decided that each student object should have a reference to its class, and there should only be one class object for the same class. We considered and compared a few designs of the rest of the model component:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `TeachBook` maintains a list of all the classes. Each class maintains a list of all the students in that class. A unique student list containing all the students in all the classes is generated every time when users execute the `list all` command.
  * Pros
    * When adding/deleting students, we only need to add/delete ONCE using a class's student list at most times.
    * The filtered student list inside `ModelManager` can take the student list of the currently selected class as its source directly.
  * Cons
    * When `list all`, we need to construct the unique student list by iterating through each class's student list, which can degrade the performance of the `list all` command.

* **Alternative 2:** `TeachBook` maintains a list of all the classes. Each class maintains a list of all the students in that class. `TeachBook` also maintains a unique student list containing all the students in all the classes.
  * Pros
    * The filtered student list inside `ModelManager` can still take the student list of the currently selected class as its source directly.
    * When `list all`, the filtered student list can also take the maintained unique student list as its source directly.
  * Cons
    * When adding/deleting students, we always need to add/delete TWICE. This means we need to modify both a class's student list and the unique student list.
    * If we simply add/delete students of the unique student list without maintaining a specific order of all the students, the list can look messy when `list all`. We may still need to do a sorting by class when `list all`, which actually also degrades the performance of `list all`.

* **Alternative 3:** `TeachBook` only maintains a unique student list containing all the students in all the classes.
  * Pros
    * Easiest to implement and most components can be reused from AB3.
    * When adding/deleting students, we only need to add/delete ONCE using the unique student list.
  * Cons
    * Similar to _Alternative 2_, there is still the need to maintain the order of students in the unique student list.
    * We always need a predicate to screen out students of the currently selected class. Since users may interact with a specific class at most times, this can degrade the performance of most commands.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Synchronization of Student List in Model and UI

To ensure synchronization throughout the program, `ModelManager` maintains a `filteredStudents` observable, which is 
observed by `MainWindow`. `filteredStudents` contains the list of students to be displayed in the UI.

![UiAndModel](images/UiAndModel.png)

`SelectCommand` and `ListCommand` with the `all` option i.e., `list all` are the only two commands that will modify the
`filteredStudents` entirely, i.e., a new observable is created and replaces the existing observable, via 
`ModelManager#updateSourceOfFilteredStudentList()`. However, this change is not observed by `MainWindow` as `MainWindow`
only observes changes within the observable, i.e., the previous `filteredStudents` observable, and not the changes to
the `filteredStudents` variable itself, which contains the observable. To mitigate this issue, the 
`updateStudentListPanel` flag, in the `commandResult` returned after the execution of both `SelectCommand` and 
`ListCommand` with the `all` option, is set to `true`. The flag then triggers the `MainWindow` to retrieve the new 
`filteredStudents` observable via the `MainWindow#updateStudentListPannel()` and start observing changes in the new 
observable. Thereafter, the student list in the UI is again in sync with the student list in the Model.

Below is the sequence diagram of the execution of the `SelectCommand`.

![SelectSequenceDiagram](images/SelectSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is the sequence diagram of the execution of the `ListCommand` with the `all` option.

![ListAllSequenceDiagram](images/ListAllSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete class feature

#### Implementation

The delete class feature allows users to delete a class and all the students in the class from the TeachBook. This feature is facilitated by `DeleteClassCommand` and `DeleteClassCommandParser`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete class mechanism behaves.

The following object diagram shows an example initial state of the TeachBook:

<img src="images/DeleteClassObjectDiagram0.png" width="520" />

The following sequence diagram shows interactions within the `Logic` component and part of the `Model` component for the `deleteClass B` command:

</div>

The following object diagram shows the updated TeachBook:

<img src="images/DeleteClassObjectDiagram1.png" width="280" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit feature

TeachBook allows users to edit students' details after initially adding the students. However, 
a student's class cannot be modified.

#### Implementation details

The edit command is implemented using `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser`, along with `TeachBookParser`
and `LogicManager` which creates the required objects. Cases where the user enters an invalid input is handled with 
exceptions along with corresponding error feedback to the user.

The edit command has the following format:
`edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

Given below is the sequence diagram on how `EditCommand` behaves in TeachBook when the user tries to edit 
the student's name at index 1 of the current class to `john`:

![EditCommandSequenceDiagram](images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Given below is the activity diagram for the same scenario above:

![EditCommandActivityDiagram](images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Filtering

Filtering is an essential feature to have when it comes to an application that stores data. This is because with 
filtering, users can access information with ease in the shortest time possible.

With reference to the discussion on 
[*Synchronization of Student List in Model and UI*](#synchronization-of-student-list-in-model-and-ui) earlier, 
at any point of time, `filteredStudents` will contain either the list of all the students from the currently 
selected class or the list of all the students from all the classes. By making `filteredStudents` a `FilteredList<Student>`,
filtering can be done easily to both the list of all the students from a class and the list of all the students from all the classes
by just passing in the corresponding `Predicate<Student>`. For example, `FindCommand` and `ListCommand` with the 
`absent` option filter the `filteredStudents` via `ModelManager#updateFilteredStudentList()` by passing in the 
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `StudentIsAbsentPredicate` respectively. To "clear" the filter on the other hand, 
there is the `ListCommand` which utilizes the `ModelManager#updateFilteredStudentList()` as well but passing in
`PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_STUDENTS` instead. Note that because filtering is done on the `filteredStudent` observable, the 
changes will be observed by the `MainWindow` and the result of filtering will be reflected immediately in the UI.

Below is the sequence diagram of the execution of the `FindCommand`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add class feature

TeachBook allows users to add classes.

#### Implementation details

The addClass command is implemented using multiple classes. Firstly, when the user input `addClass A`, the LogicManager
will invoke the parseCommand of TeachBookParser to create a addClassCommandParse object. The parse method in 
the AddClassCommandParser will be called to parse the inputs. It will create a class object named `A` and then return a
`addClassCommand` object. The returned `addClassCommand` then runs the `execute()` method which will in turn invoke the chain of
`addClass()`, `addClass()`, `add()` and `add()` command by the `model`, `TeachBook`, `UniqueClassList` and `ObservableList` classes
respectively.

The addClass command has the following format:
`addClass CLASS_NAME`

Given below is the sequence diagram on how addClass Command behaves in TeachBook when the user tries to add a class
named `A`.

![AddClassSequenceDiagram](images/AddClassSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddClassCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTeachBook`. It extends `TeachBook` with an undo/redo history, each state is stored internally as an `TeachbookDataState` which consist of a `TeachBook` and `TeachbookDisplayState`. `TeachbookDisplayState` stored the filter predicate for the student list if any is applied and also the index of the selected class to be displayed.
The `TeachbookDataState` is stored in a `TeachbookStateList` with a `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTeachBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current TeachBook state in its history.
* `VersionedTeachBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous TeachBook state from its history.
* `VersionedTeachBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone TeachBook state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTeachBook()`, `Model#undoTeachBook()` and `Model#redoTeachBook()` respectively.

`Model#undoTeachBook()` and `Model#redoTeachBook()` will return display settings to update the model accordingly.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTeachBook` will be initialized with the initial TeachbookDataState, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single TeachBook state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the Teachbook. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitTeachBook()`, causing the modified TeachbookDatastate after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `teachBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted TeachBook state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)


Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitTeachBook()`, causing another modified TeachbookDatastate to be saved into the `teachBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTeachBook()`, so the TeachBook state will not be saved into the `teachBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTeachBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous TeachBook state, and restores the Teachbook to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial TeachBook state, then there are no previous TeachBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTeachBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoTeachBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the TeachBook to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `teachBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest TeachBook state, then there are no undone TeachBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoTeachBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the TeachBook, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitTeachBook()`, `Model#undoTeachBook()` or `Model#redoTeachBook()`. Thus, the `teachBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitTeachBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `teachBookStateList`, all TeachBook states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (choice):** Saves the entire TeachBook.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* is a primary or secondary school teacher
* has a need to manage multiple class worth of students' contacts that she is teaching
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* is not proficient in IT but can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* wants to keep her personal contacts and students' contacts separate
* wants to better take care of her students by storing some special notes (e.g. allergy condition) of her students somewhere
* wants to have an app to help with administrative work in teaching (e.g. taking attendance, keying in grades of students)

**Value proposition**: Manages contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app. Allows teachers to have a dedicated 
app to keep their work life separated from their personal life. Allows teachers to find students and their emergency 
information accurately and easily. Assists teachers with their day to day administrative work such as marking of attendance
and grading.
