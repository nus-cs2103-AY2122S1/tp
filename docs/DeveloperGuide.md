### Architecture

<a href="https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/ArchitectureDiagram.png">

</a>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mycrm/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mycrm/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteContact 1`.

<a href="https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png">
<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />
</a>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<a href="https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/ComponentManagers.png">
<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />
</a>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mycrm/ui/Ui.java)

[![](images/UiClassDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/UiClassDiagram.png)

<center></center>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MainDisplay`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mycrm/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Job`, `Mail`, `Contact`, `Product`, `Template`, `History`
  objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mycrm/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

[![](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `MyCRMParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. `StateManager` checks to see whether the parsed command can currently be executed depending on the current state of the application.
   If it can the `Command` object is executed by the `LogicManager`.
4. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object.
6. For certain commands `StateManager` intercepts this `CommandResult` object. It communicates with model to perform extra operations and modifies the
   `CommandResult` accordingly.
7. The `CommandResult` object is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("addJob c/1 p/1 d/Fix...")` API call.

[![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addJob c/1 p/1 d/Fix...` Command](images/job/AddJobSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/job/AddJobSequenceDiagram.png)

Please refer to [StateManager](#statemanager) for a more detailed explanation on its motivation and implementation.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<a href="https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/ParserClasses.png">
<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
</a>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `MyCrmParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `MyCrmParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<a href="https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/ModelClassDiagram.png">

</a>

<a href="https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/ModelTemplateClassDiagram.png">

<img src="images/ModelMailClassDiagram.png" height="250" />
</a>

The `Model` component,

* stores the MyCrm data i.e:
  * all `Contact` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` object).
  * all `Product` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueProductList` object).
  * all `Template` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTemplateList` object).
  * all `Job` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueJobList` object).
  * all `Mail` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueMailList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Contact`, `Product`, `Template`,`Job`and `Mail` objects (e.g., results of a 
  search query)  as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable 
  `ObservableList<Contact>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI 
  automatically updates when the data in the list change. 
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<a href="https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/StorageClassDiagram.png">
<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600" />
</a>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both MyCrm data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `MyCrmStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.mycrm.commons` package.

### Adding a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Adding a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This Contact created is stored internally using
`UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCrm` object.  
Additionally, `addContact` allows to have only partially info of a client with consideration of privacy. Commands
such as `AddContact n/xxx e/xxx` `addContact n/xxx c/xxx` are all acceptable.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `addContact` command behave when executed by a user:

[![](images/contact/AddContactActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/AddContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Adding a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/contact/AddContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/AddContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `AddContactCommandParser#parse`, `ParserUtil#parseName` will be called to create a name using
"Sans", `ParserUtil#parsePhone` to create a phone using "83921823", `ParserUtil#parseEmail` to
create an email using "Sans@gmail.com", `ParserUtil#parseAddress` to create an address using "Maxwell...".  
Then create a contact using the new name, phone, email and address.

Note that `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, are optional, but at least one of these 3 fields
must exist.

[![](images/contact/AddContactSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/AddContactSequenceDiagram.png)

Note: Please refer to [StateManager](#statemanager) for more details on why the command result of the AddContactCommand is intercepted.

### Editing a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Editing a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism reads and modifies a target contact
object from `UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `editContact` command behave when executed by a user:

[![](images/contact/EditContactActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/EditContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Editing a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/contact/EditContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/EditContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `EditContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of contactList).
- `EditContactDescriptor` will only get the values of `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, and `Tags`
if their respective prefixes are present.
- `isHidden` is will not be handled by `EditContactDescrptior`, it will be updated in `createEditedContact`.

`EditContactCommandParser#parse` will call `ArgumentMultimap#getPreamble` to get the target contact's index and
`ArgumentMultimap#getValue` to extract `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`: "Frisks", "88888888", "Frisks@gmail.com"
and "Jurong West" from the command string respectively.

[![](images/contact/EditContactSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/EditContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Deleting a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Deleting a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism reads and deletes a target contact
object from `UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `deleteContact` command behave when executed by a user:

[![](images/contact/DeleteContactActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/DeleteContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Deleting a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/contact/DeleteContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/DeleteContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `DeleteContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of contactList).
- The contact specified to be deleted must have no jobs linked, otherwise error message will be displayed in UI panel.

`DeleteContactCommandParser#parse` will call `ParserUtil#parseIndex` to get the target contact's index to delete it.

[![](images/contact/DeleteContactSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/DeleteContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Finding a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Finding a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism finds specific list of contact
object from `UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCRM` object with certain keywords provided.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `findContact` command behave when executed by a user:

[![](images/contact/FindContactActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/FindContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Finding a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/contact/FindContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/FindContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)


Within `FindContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Keywords` must be presented. (At least one trim of String)

`FindContactCommandParser#parse` will call `String#trim` and `String#split` to get list of keywords
in order for MyCRM to find corresponding contacts with these keywords as predicate.

[![](images/contact/FindContactSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/FindContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Hiding a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Hiding a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by the `MyCRM`. It hides a specific contact
which is visible only when user types the command `listContact -a`. Hidden contact will be tagged as `Hidden`.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `hideContact` command behave when executed by a user:

[![](images/contact/HideContactActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/HideContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Hiding a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/contact/HideContactParserSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/HideContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `HideContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of contactList).

`HideContactCommandParser#parse` will call `ParserUtil#parseIndex` to get the target contact's index to hide it.

[![](images/contact/HideContactSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/HideContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Undoing Hiding a Contact

#### Implementation

The **Undoing Hiding a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by the `MyCRM`. It will unhide a hidden contact in list. Users are
required to type in command `listContact -a` in order to see **hidden** contacts.

Implementation and usage details for **Undoing Hiding a Contact** are similar to [Hiding a Contact](#hiding-a-contact) design
pattern. Can refer to `hideContact` command implementation details.
#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `undoHideContact` command behave when executed by a user:

[![](images/contact/UndoHideContactActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/UndoHideContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Undoing Hiding a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/contact/UndoHideContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/UndoHideContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `UndoHideContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `listContact -a` must first be typed in to see hidden contacts.
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of contactList).

`UndoHideContactCommandParser#parse` will call `ParserUtil#parseIndex`

[![](images/contact/UndoHideContactSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/UndoHideContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Listing Contacts

#### Implementation

The **Listing a Contact** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism lists all unhidden Contact
object from `UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCRM` object by default. If `listContact -a` is invoked,
`MyCRM` will list all contacts including not hidden ones.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `listContact` command behave when executed by a user:

[![](images/contact/ListContactActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/ListContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the **Listing a Contact** mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/contact/ListContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/ListContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `ListContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Keywords` is optional but if provided, it can only be **"-a"**.
- If correct keyword is presented, contact list will show all contacts including hidden contacts.
If not, by default `listContact` will only show not hidden contacts in contact list.

`ListcontactCommandParser#parse` will call `String#trim` to get specific keyword.

[![](images/contact/ListContactSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/contact/ListContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Adding a Template

#### Implementation

The **Adding a Template** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This template created is stored internally using
`UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `addTemplate` command behave when executed by user:

[![](images/mail/AddTemplateActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/mail/AddTemplateActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Adding a Template mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/mail/AddTemplateParseSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/mail/AddTemplateParseSequenceDiagram.png)

**Parse user input**

Within `AddTemplateCommandParser#parse`, `ParserUtil#parseSubject` will be called to create a subject using
"Completed", `ParserUtil#parseBody` to create a body using "Dear customer..." and create a template using the new
subject and body.

[![](images/mail/AddTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/mail/AddTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)

Additionally, before adding the new template into `Model`, `Template t` will be checked if a similar copy exist
within `Model`. The conditions required is:

* If both templates have the DO NOT same `Subject` content i.e. there is an existing template with subject "Completed".

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Unique Template**

* Current choice: Unique by Subject
  * Pros: Easy to understand and differentiate templates
  * Cons: Does not allow for different variations of general / common email headers i.e. "Completed" subject header
    cannot be reused with different body content based on scenario
* Alternative: Unique by Subject and Body
  * Pros: Enables different variations of general / common email headers
  * Cons: May not be user-friendly as it may be hard to differentiate templates as some may be too similar at first
    glance. Such as, minor typos, copy and paste with a couple of different words. Higher risk of confusion.    

### Editing a Template

#### Implementation

The **Editing a Template** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism reads and modifies a target template
object from `UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

Within `EditTemplateCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of templates).
- `EditTemplateDescriptor` will only get the values of `Subject` and `Body` if their respective prefixes are present.

`EditTemplateCommandParser#parse` will call `ArgumentMultimap#getPreamble` to get the specified template index and
`ArgumentMultimap#getValue` to extract both `Subject` and `Body`: "Completed" and "Order Completed!" from the
command string respectively.

[![](images/mail/EditTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/mail/EditTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)

### Deleting a Template

#### Implementation

The **Deleting a Template** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This template removes a target template object from
`UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `deleteTemplate` command behave when executed by user:

[![](images/mail/DeleteTemplateActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/mail/DeleteTemplateActivityDiagram.png)

**Parse user input**

Within `FindTemplateCommandParser#parse`,
-  At least one keyword must be presented.
-  Keyword specified must be whole word.

`FindTemplateCommandParser#parse` will call `String#trim` and `String#split` to get list of keywords
in order for MyCRM to find corresponding templates with these keywords as predicate.

[![](images/mail/FindTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/mail/FindTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)

### Constructing an Email

#### Implementation

The **Constructing an Email** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This email is constructed based of the information
from <u>a specified job and template</u> from `UniqueJobList` and `UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object. <u>A
mailto URL</u> will be generated, sending users to their default mailing application with details of the job and
template.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `mail` command behave when executed by user:

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Constructing an Email mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/mail/MailParseSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/mail/MailParseSequenceDiagram.png)

**Parse user input**

Within `MailCommandParser#parse`,
- `JobIndex` must be is valid (within the range of job).
- `TemplateIndex` must be is valid (within the range of templates).
- `ParserUtil#parseIndex` will be called to extract both the index of the specified job and template to mail.

[![](images/mail/MailSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/mail/MailSequenceDiagram.png)

An additional feature of constructing an email is the generation of a mailto URL, allowing for users to transfer
their job and template details to the user's default mailing application.

Given below is an example of the **generation of a mailto URL**:

[![](images/mail/MailUrlSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/mail/MailUrlSequenceDiagram.png)

After the URL is generated, the URL string is passed to a JavaFX <u>Hyperlink</u> object that when clicked, will
execute the URL path.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Mailing Extension**

* Current choice: mailto URL
    * Pros: Easy to implement, is not limited to any specific email application, does not require user's email account.
    * Cons: Does not allow for direct (immediate) sending of mail to client email addresses.
* Alternative: Embedding Oauth with email service
    * Pros: Enables direct and quick sending of email directly from MyCRM application
    * Cons: Higher complexity in implementation with JavaFX, requires internet access to save drafts of emails,
      requires the storage and security assurance of user sensitive data (email account information), and limited
      management number of email accounts i.e. swapping different email services like Gmail and Outlook

### Adding a Product

#### Implementation

The **Adding a Product** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This product created is stored internally using
`UniqueProductList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `addProduct` command behave when executed by user:

[![](images/product/AddProductActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/product/AddProductActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/product/AddProductSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/product/AddProductSequenceDiagram.png)

Note: Please refer to [StateManager](#statemanager) for more details on why the command result of the AddProductCommand is intercepted.

**Parse user input**

Within `AddProductCommandParser#parse`, the **factory methods** of product components (`getProductName` and
`getEmptyProductName` for product name, `getType` and `getEmptyType` for type, ...) will be invoked to create product
component objects: name, type, manufacturer, description.

**Note**: Name is *compulsory* for creating a product, whereas type, manufacturer and description are *optional* fields.

[![](images/product/AddProductSequenceDiagram_Parse.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/product/AddProductSequenceDiagram_Parse.png)

### Editing a Product

#### Implementation

The **Editing a Product** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism first reads the target product object from
`UniqueProductList`, then creates a new product object with <u>user input fields</u> and <u>unchanged fields of target
product</u>. Lastly, it replaces the target product with the new one, updates its references in jobs, and updates UI.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `editProduct` command behave when executed by user:

[![](images/product/EditProductActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/product/EditProductActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

[![](images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram.png)

**Parse user input**

Within `EditProductCommandParser#parse`,
* EditProductCommandParser will only get the values of fields(`name`, `manufacturer`, `type`, `description`) if their
  respective prefixes are present.

`EditTemplateCommandParser#parse` will call `ArgumentMultimap#getPreamble` to get the specified product index and
`ArgumentMultimap#getValue` to extract product name “Asus” and description “DisplayPort, HDMI” from user input
respectively.

[![](images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram_Parse.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram_Parse.png)

**Updates product references in jobs**

After target product is replaced with new product, `EditProductCommand#execute()` will traverse job list and replace
references to target product with references to new product.

To get the full job list, `EditProductCommand#execute()` will store the *lastest predicate* of job list and set the
predicate to "show all jobs". After traversing the job list and updating the references, the *latest predicate* is
restored.

<u>Design Consideration</u>: An alternative way to get full job list is to retrieve the underlying `UniqueJobList` through
`Model`. `EditProductCommand` is implemented in the other way as directly accessing and modifying `UniqueJobList` leads to an
association between `EditProductCommand` and `UniqueJobList`, which increases coupling.

[![](images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram_Sync.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/product/EditProductSequenceDiagram_Sync.png)

### StateManager

#### Motivation

As seen from the description of the [Model Component](#model-component) the job entity holds a reference to exactly one contact and product entity.
As such, one key consideration behind job related commands was providing an easy and flexible way for users to choose to assign either
existing or new contact and/or products to jobs. As an example, when a user is adding a new job, the product or contact information needed might already exist in MyCRM,
if there have been prior repairs on the same product or if it is a repeat client. In such cases the user will want to assign an existing contact and/or product to the new job.
In other cases a new job will require creation of new contact and product entities not already present in MyCRM and subsequent assignment of these new contact and/or product entities
to the job. The goal of `StateManager` is to handle these various scenarios amd make the process of assigning contacts and products to jobs easy for the user.

#### Implementation

The description of the [Logic Component](#logic-component) describes at a high level how `StateManager` controls which commands can be executed by `LogicManager`
and how `StateManager` intercepts results of a `Command` to perform additional operations (if needed) by communicating with the `Model`.

Here is a more detailed look at how `StateManager` works:
1. Internally it has a list of possible states of the application. Based on the commands executed it remembers the current state of the application.
   e.g. If a `addJob` command is issued without a contact index, that job will not be added to `MyCRM` immediately.
   Instead, StateManager` will remember that a job is being added, and needs a contact assigned to it.
2. Each state has a corresponding list of allowed commands that are permitted in that state. It prevents `LogicManager` from executing commands not permitted for the
   current state. e.g When a contact is being assigned to a job, some commands that are allowed (non-exhaustive) are `addContact`, `listContact`, `findContact` etc...
3. When a command is executed, the state manager might intercept its `CommandResult`, to perform additional operations and update its internal state.
   e.g After an `addContact` command, `StateManager` will check the current state to see if a job is currently being added. If so state manager will link it to that job.
   If the job is complete (does not require assignment of a product), it will be added to `MyCRM` and the job creation will be complete. Otherwise, `StateManager` will update
   its internal state to remember that a job is being added, and needs a product assigned to it.
4. The `CommandResult` is modified suitably based on additional operations performed before being returned to `LogicManager`. This is so that the user is able to see
   appropriate feedback on what operations were completed.

While the above examples were in the context of `addJob` commands, `StateManager` plays a identical role in helping with the reassignment of contact and/or product for existing jobs, via the
`editJob` command.

The two activity diagrams below illustrates the events that might occur when MyCRM prompts the user to assign a contact and/or product to a job. This can happen after the user
has issued an `addJob` or `editJob` command without a contact or product index.

[![Activity diagram of assigning contact to job](images/job/AssigningContactActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/job/AssigningContactActivityDiagram.png)

[![Activity diagram of assigning product to job](images/job/AssigningProductActivtyDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/job/AssigningProductActivtyDiagram.png)

Notice that the user can still choose to select an existing contact and/or product even if their index wasnt provided in the `addJob` or `editJob` command itself.
This is made possible using a `select` command.

Also notice that the user can call an `abort` command to exit from the current operation.
`StateManager` will clear its state, and the adding or editing of the job will not go through.

### Adding a Job

#### Implementation

The **Adding a Job** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. Similar to other entities like products or contacts, jobs created
are stored internally using`UniqueJobList` inside the `MyCrm` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates the possible workflows when the `addJob` command is being executed by the user.

[![Activity diagram of add job](images/job/AddJobActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/job/AddJobActivityDiagram.png)

Notice that in the case the contact and/or product index are not provided `StateManager` will prompt for the two entities sequentially.
First it checks if the contact has been assigned, and then it checks if the product is assigned.
If only one of contact or product index is missing, `StateManager` will only ask for assignment of the missing entity.

In the [Logic Component](#logic-component) a high level sequence diagram is shown for when both the contact or product index are provided, and the job is added to MyCRM.

The below sequence diagram shows an example usage scenario where the product index is missing.
Notice how the job is passed to the `StateManager` but not added to the model, because the job does not have a product assigned.

[![Sequence diagram of add job](images/job/AddJobSequenceDiagramShort.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/job/AddJobSequenceDiagramShort.png)

**Parsing of user input**

As seen from the description of the [Model Component](#model-component) the job entity has many subcomponents such as `JobDescription`, `JobFee`,
`JobDate`, etc... Within `AddJobCommandParser#parse`, methods from `ParserUtil` are used to create these job subcomponents, before creating the job to be added to `MyCRM`.

[![Sequence diagram of parsing user input](images/job/AddJobParseSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/job/AddJobParseSequenceDiagram.png)

### Editing a job

#### Implementation
The **Editing a Job** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. Similar to the other entities, this mechanism first reads the target job object from
`UniqueJobList`, and then creates a new job object with the <u>user input fields</u> in the `editJob` command and <u>unchanged fields of target
job</u>. Lastly, it replaces the target job with the new one and is reflected in the updated UI.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates the possible workflows when the `editJob` command is being executed by the user.

Notice one difference between the workflow between `addJob` and `editJob`. Even though the user doesn't have to provide the contact or product index in the command itself,
the user still has to indicate an intention to reassign the contact and/or product of the existing job. This is done by providing the contact or product prefixes in the command
without their index, e.g `editJob INDEX c/ p/`

[![Activity diagram of edit job](images/job/EditJobActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/job/EditJobActivityDiagram.png)

The below sequence diagram shows an example usage scenario where both the contact and product indexes are present.

[![Sequence diagram of edit job](images/job/EditJobSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/job/EditJobSequenceDiagram.png)

The parsing for `editJob` is similar to `addJob` where methods from `ParserUtil` are used to create the sub-components,
before creating the edited version of the job.

### Printing a monthly job report

#### Implementation

The **Printing a monthly job report** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This job report is generated based of the information from
<u>jobs completed in this month</u> and <u> received in this month</u> from `UniqueJobList` inside `MyCRM` object. A report window
will be created with details of completed jobs, in-progress jobs, top three popular products, and a bar graph showing monthly revenue.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `printReport` command behave when executed by user:

[![Activity diagram of print report](images/report/PrintReportActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/report/PrintReportActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

[![Sequence diagram of print report parser](images/report/PrintReportParserSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/report/PrintReportParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `PrintReportCommandParser#parse`,
- `CommandFlag` is optional but if provided, it can only be either **"-i"** or **"-p"**.
- If **"-i"** is presented, report window will show all in-progress jobs received in this month.
- If **"-i"** is presented, report window will show the top three popular products in this month. 
- if no flag is presented, report windwo will shou all jobs completed in this month by default.

`PrintReportCommandParser#parse` will call `String#trim` to get specific command flag.

[![Sequence diagram of print report](images/report/PrintReportSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/report/PrintReportSequenceDiagram.png)

### Exporting a monthly job report

#### Implementation

The **Exporting a monthly job report** mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This job report is generated based of the information from
<u>jobs completed in this month</u> and <u> received in this month</u> from `UniqueJobList` inside `MyCRM` object. Then `MyCRM` will export
the job report by printer or as PDF format.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `printReport` command behave when executed by user:

[![Activity diagram of export report](images/report/ExportReportActivityDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/report/ExportReportActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

[![Sequence diagram of export report parser](images/report/ExportReportParserSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/report/ExportReportParserSequenceDiagram.png)

[![Sequence diagram of export report](images/report/ExportReportSequenceDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/report/ExportReportSequenceDiagram.png)

The implementation detail of `fillInnerParts` method call  is similar to `printReport`.
