### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteElderly 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ElderlyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Elderly` and `Task` objects residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `NurseyBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an elderly).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteElderly 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteElderly 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `NurseyBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `NurseyBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png"/>

The `Model` component,

* stores the nursey book data i.e., all `Elderly` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueElderlyList` object) and all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Elderly` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Elderly>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects in a similar way to `Elderly` objects which is also exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>`.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores the states of the nursey book after the execution of commands that change the data in `NurseyBookState` objects.
* depends on some classes in the `Logic` component because the `Model` component saves the result after the execution of commands that change the data of nursey book.
* does not depend on the `Storage` and `Ui` components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, it should make sense on its own without depending on `Storage` and `Ui`)

The class diagram below shows more details regarding `Person`, `Elderly`, `NoK`(Next of kin) and `Task` classes in the `Model` component.

<img src="images/DetailedModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both NurseyBook data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `NurseyBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `nurseybook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### ViewElderly and ViewTasks feature

#### How `CommandResult` is changed
As nursey book has to support the display of two different lists (contacts vs task), each `CommandResult` object will now store the information which list should be displayed to the user.

The following class diagram shows the changes made to the `CommandResult` class. Each `CommandResult` has an enum that specifies the type of display.

* `CommandResult#ListDisplayChange.ELDERLY`â€‰â€”â€‰Specifies the elderly list to be displayed after the current command execution
* `CommandResult#ListDisplayChange.TASK`â€‰â€”â€‰Specifies the task list to be displayed after the current command execution
* `CommandResult#ListDisplayChange.NONE`â€‰â€”â€‰Specifies the type of displayed list should not change after the current command execution

<img src="images/ViewElderlyClassDiagram.png" alt="View Elderly Class Diagram" width="200" />

#### How `MainWindow` processes `CommandResult`
`MainWindow#handleChange()` is a new method that handles the switching of the list display. It checks if a `CommandResult` object specifies the change of list display, and changes the UI accordingly.

#### Execution
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the display of elderly/task list mechanism behaves at each step. An example command is `viewElderly`, and the mechanism of `viewTasks` is similar.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The default display of nursey book shows the list of all elderly that were added in.

Step 2. The user runs a few other available commands, and wants to switch back to the default display with the elderly, thus executes the `viewElderly` command.

Step 3. `MainWindow#executeCommand("viewElderly")` is called. Within the method body, it calls the `LogicManager#execute()` which returns a new `CommandResult`.

Step 4. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` processes the `CommandResult`. It calls `MainWindow#handleChange()` to change the display of the list, to show all elderly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens in the `MainWindow` class when the user enters either the `viewElderly` or `viewTasks` command.

![ViewElderlyActivityDiagram](./images/ViewElderlyActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: How to display elderlies and tasks separately**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using commands `viewElderly` and `viewTasks`, switch the display in the main window between the elderly list and task list stored in `NurseyBook`.
    * Pros: Cleaner display, able to display the necessary information without cluttering the display window
    * Cons: The need to implement two new commands, `viewElderly` and `viewTask` for the user to view the two lists respectively. The code for the two commands might contain repetition due to the similarity in function.
    
* **Alternative 2:** Display the list of elderly and list of tasks side by side in the same display window.
    * Pros: Implementation/Creation of new commands are not needed. The user is able to type less yet still view what he/she is interested in.
    * Cons: With two different lists (that contain different objects) displayed side by side, the display might seem cluttered and hard to read from. It negatively impacts the user experience.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### ViewDetails feature

#### How `CommandResult` is changed
Similar to `help`, `viewElderly` and `viewTasks`, this features requires a UI-specific operation (i.e. opening/closing the details panel). As the main method of communication between logic and
UI lies within `CommandResult`, the following additions have been made to the `CommandResult` class:

* `CommandResult#isViewDetails`â€‰â€”â€‰Specifies the elderly list to be displayed after the current command execution

#### How `MainWindow` processes `CommandResult`
* `MainWindow#handleViewDetails()` is a new method that handles the opening of the details panel and populating with the details of the specified elderly. It is called whenever a `viewDetails` command has been executed successfully.
* `MainWindow#handleNonViewDetails()` is a new method that handles the closing of the details panel. It is called whenever any command except `viewDetails` command has been executed successfully.

#### How `Model` is changed
Model now also has at most one `Elderly` object chosen to be displayed in full at each point of time. Thus, the following additions have been made to the `ModelManager` class:

* `ModelManager#elderlyOfInterest`â€‰â€”â€‰Specifies the elderly whose details are to be displayed in full

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Execution

The following sequence diagram shows how this operation works but leaves out the details regarding parsing:

![ViewDetailsSequenceDiagram](./images/ViewDetailsSequenceDiagram.png)

Parsing works similar to [`doneTask`](#mark-a-task-as-done-feature) feature below: a `ViewDetailsCommandParser` parses the Index which is passed to the `ViewDetailsCommand`. The Index identifies the elderly whose full details should be shown.

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: How to pass an elderly object to UI**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using a new field in Model to indicate which elderly to be displayed
    * Pros: Better abstraction between each high-level component.
    * Cons: There might not always be an elderly to display, thus the field may sometimes be null, which require extra checks to prevent errors.

* **Alternative 2:**  CommandResult storing an elderly
    * Pros: Simpler implementation, elderly can be passed to MainWindow through the CommandResult without auxiliary methods.
    * Cons: Does not make logical sense for `CommandResult` to have an elderly field as not all commands (and by extension: command result) involve an elderly.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete NoK feature

#### Implementation
The implementation of `DeleteNokCommand` is highly similar to that of `DeleteCommand`. Major differences are in how the steps 5 and 6 below are handled.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete NoK mechanism behaves at each step. The example command is `deleteNok 1`.

Step 1. The user lists all elderlies with `viewElderly` and executes `deleteNok 1` command to delete the NoK details of the first elderly in the elderly list. This prompts the `LogicManager` to start its execution by calling its `execute()` command.

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls the `NurseyBookParser` to parse the command.

Step 3. The `NurseyBookParser` creates a new `DeleteNokCommandParser` object and calls its `parse` method to parse the arguments. This creates and returns a new `DeleteNokCommand` which is ready to be executed, containing the index of the target elderly as one of its fields.

Step 4. The `DeleteNokCommand` is executed by calling its `execute()` method. This calls the `Model#getFilteredElderlyList()` and retrieves the filtered elderly list, which should contain all elderlies.

Step 5. A new updated Elderly object is created with all fields equivalent to the targeted Elderly object, apart from the NoK fields which are wiped. This process has been omitted from the sequence diagram below.

Step 6. The `Model#setElderly()` method is then called to replace the targeted Elderly with the updated Elderly object.

Step 7. A new `CommandResult` is returned which contains the details of the new Elderly object. The result is returned to `LogicManager`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the find task operation works:

![DeleteNokSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteNokSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**
The lifeline for `DeleteNokCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Filter feature

#### Implementation
The implementation of the filter command is facilitated by the `FilterCommand` class and `ElderlyHasTagPredicate` class.
`ElderlyHasTagPredicate` contains a set of tags that was queried in the filter command and has a method `test`
to test whether an Elderly has all the tags in the set.

Given below is the class diagram of the `FilterCommand` and the `ElderlyHasTagPredicate`.

![FilterClassDiagram](images/FilterClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagrams show how the filter command works:

The following sequence diagram shows how the FilterCommand object is created:

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram below shows how the FilterCommand object is executed:

![FilterSequenceDiagramPart2](images/FilterSequenceDiagramPart2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**
The lifeline for `FilterCommand` and `ElderlyHasTagPredicate` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

As tags can only be alphanumeric, the `parse` method in `FilterCommandParser` checks that the all the tags queried are valid first before creating the `FilterCommand` and `ElderlyHasTagPredicate` objects.
If there is a tag that is invalid, an exception will be thrown.

When executing the filter command, the `updateFilteredElderlyList` method of `Model` calls other methods that are omitted from the diagram.
One of the methods then calls the `test` method of the `ElderlyHasTagPredicate` object with every `Elderly` saved in nursey book. The checking for the presence of tags is case-insensitive. 
The list of `Elderly` that return true for `test` is then assigned to `filteredElderlies` in `ModelManager` and displayed in the GUI.

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How to store tags** 

* **Alternative 1:** Create a new class `TagSet` to store tags
    * Pros: Allows addition of custom methods
    * Cons: More code needs to be written and more room for bugs
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use `java.util.Set` to store tags
    * Pros: Easy to import and use
    * Cons: Methods that can be used are limited to the methods in `Set`

Alternative 2 was chosen as the tags are simply kept as a collection.
Only the simple operations such as checking whether a `Tag` is in the `Set` and changing the `Tag`s in the set are needed.
Thus, the methods provided in `java.util.Set` are sufficient and there is no need to implement custom methods.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Mark a task as done feature

#### How task status is changed
`Task` now contains `Status`, which stores the completion status of the task. `Task` now implements the following operations:

* `Task#markAsDone()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets the task's completion status as done

`UniqueTaskList` uses the method above to mark the specified task as done in `UniqueTaskList#markTaskAsDone(Task toMark)`. This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#markTaskAsDone(Task target)`.

#### How the target task is identified
First, the `DoneTaskCommandParser` parses the `Index` which is passed to the `DoneTaskCommand`.  The `Index` identifies the task to be marked as done.

The following sequence diagram shows how this operation works:

![DoneTaskSequenceDiagram](images/DoneTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters the command for this feature:

![DoneTaskActivityDiagram](images/DoneTaskActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Overdue tasks

#### How task status is changed
`Status` under `Task` does not only store the completion status of the task, but the overdue status as well. A task is "overdue" if its scheduled date and time passes the current date and time.

* `Task#markAsOverdue()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets the task's overdue status as done

`UniqueTaskList` uses the method above to mark the specified task as overdue in `UniqueTaskList#markTaskAsOverdue(Task toMark)`. This operation occurs in the `Model` interface under the `Model#updateTasksAccordingToTime()`, which is defined in `ModelManager#updateTasksAccordingToTime()`. The method in `ModelManager` then calls `NurseyBook#updateTasksOverdueStatus()`.

#### How a task is identified as overdue
The `DateTime` of a task is checked in the functions `Task#shouldTaskBeOverdue()` and `Task#isPastCurrentDateAndRecurringTask()`. Under the definition for both functions, the `DateTime` is passed into the static method `DateTime#isOverdue(DateTime dt)` to check if the scheduled date and time of the task is past the current date and time.

More implementation details on the updating of a task's overdue status can be referred to under a later section, [handling of overdue and recurring tasks](#handling-of-overdue-and-recurring-tasks).

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: How to display the status of a task being overdue to users**

Note: This section is relevant to one-off, overdue tasks. For more details on recurring tasks, refer to later sections, [add recurring task feature](#add-recurring-task-feature) and [handling of overdue and recurring tasks](#handling-of-overdue-and-recurring-tasks).

When a task is overdue, its overdue status is `true`. In the user interface, it will have a red overdue tag attached to it. The red tag was implemented to be eye-catching, highlighting the task's incomplete status. However, the issue arises when the task is overdue (past curren date and time) and completed. The red tag no longer needs to be present to distract the user from other overdue yet incomplete tasks.

* **Alternative 1:** When a task is marked as done, toggle the overdue status of the task to `false`. In this case, when the date and time of the task has passed, the completion and overdue status of a task will always be opposite. (When the date and time of a task has not yet passed, both completion and overdue statuses are `false`.)
    * Pros: Marking a task as overdue, and displaying the results will not involve the `UI` component, keeping the implementation and changes within the `Model` component.
    * Cons: This suggested implementation will overcomplicate the operation. Furthermore, if a task is marked as done, it is still considered as overdue by its date and time. It does not make sense to change the overdue status to `false`.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice) :** When a task is marked as done, hide the display of the overdue tag in the `TaskListCard.java`.
    * Pros: An easier implementation, by just checking if a task is both completed and overdue, we hide the overdue tag when displaying the task in the task list.

Alternative 2 is chosen as `UI` class has the duty to listen to changes to `Model` data so the UI can be updated with the modified data. As the second implementation is easier and is more logical, it is chosen.

The following sequence diagram shows how this operation works:

Diagram 1:

![OverdueTasksSequenceDiagram1](images/OverdueTaskSequenceDiagram1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Diagram 2:

![OverdueTasksSequenceDiagram2](images/OverdueTaskSequenceDiagram2.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add recurring task feature

#### Implementation
Task now contains `Recurrence`,  which encapsulates the recurrence type of the task. There are 4 recurrence types:
1. `NONE`: Non-recurring (one-off) `Task`
2. `DAY`: Recurring `Task` that repeats daily
3. `WEEKLY`: Recurring `Task` that repeats weekly (every 7 days)
4. `MONTHLY`: Recurring `Task` that repeats every 4 weeks

If a user does not specify the `Recurrence` when adding a new `Task`, it will default to a `NONE` `Recurrence` type.

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: When should the task date be changed based on its `Recurrence` type**

* **Alternative 1:** Once a user has marked a recurring `Task` as done, the date of the `Task` will be automatically changed to the next date according to its `Recurrence` type, with its completion status reset to be undone.
    * Pros: User experience could be more intuitive, as the user can focus on the next deadline rather than the current completed task.
    * Cons: There is an increase in coupling between the `Task`â€™s `Status`, `Recurrence` and `DateTime`. `DateTime` now needs to depend on `Status` and `Recurrence` to decide if its date and time needs to be changed. This can increase bugs and make testing harder, as more functions would have side effects (resetting taskâ€™s completion `Status` and updating `Task`â€™s `DateTime`).

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Once a `DateTime` of a `Task` has been passed, it will trigger nursey book to update to the new `DateTime` of the `Task`, according to its `Recurrence` type.
    * Pros: Easier to implement, because there is only one condition that needs to be checked (if the `Task`â€™s `DateTime` is before the current `DateTime`) for the `Task`â€™s `DateTime` to be updated.
    * Cons: Restricted choice for users who would prefer seeing upcoming tasks to seeing completed tasks.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Handling of overdue and recurring tasks

#### Implementation
The logic for handling overdue and recurring tasks are handled in `ModelManager#updateTasksAccordingToTime()`.

```     java
    @Override
    public void updateTasksAccordingToTime() {
        versionedNurseyBook.updateRecurringTasksDate();
        versionedNurseyBook.updateTasksOverdueStatus();
        versionedNurseyBook.reorderTasksChronologically();
    }
```

These individual functions, `updateRecurringTasksDate()`, `updateTasksOverdueStatus()` and `reorderTasksChronologically()` are defined in [`NurseyBook.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/model/NurseyBook.java) and their implementations are listed before.
1. `updateRecurringTasksDate()`
    *  This function checks whether a `Task` is overdue (`Task`'s `DateTime` is before the current `DateTime`) and if it is a recurring task (`Task#isRecurring` is `true`), before updating recurring tasks' `DateTime` as needed at the current time.
2. `updateTasksOverdueStatus()`
    *  This function first checks for either of 2 cases:
        * Whether a task is overdue (`Status#isOverdue` is `true`) and should not be overdue after the change of its `DateTime` under `updateRecurringTasksDate()`.
        * Whether a task is not overdue and should be overdue.
    *  Then updates overdue statuses accordingly:
        * For first case, it marks the task as overdue.
        * For second case, it marks the task as not overdue.
3. `reorderTasksChronologically()`
    * This function sorts the tasks in chronological order, whose order might be disrupted due to changes in `DateTime` of tasks due to `updateRecurringTasksDate()`. Causes could be
        * `updateRecurringTasksDate()`
        * execution of an `editTask` command
        * undo-ing/redo-ing an `editTask` command
    
Listed below are some situations and corresponding implementations where the overdue `Status` and `DateTime` might be changed, based on either a manual edit of the `Task`'s `DateTime` and/or `Recurrence` type, or simply the passing of time.

1. `DateTime` of non-recurring `Task` has passed current `DateTime`
    * Mark `Status#isOverdue` to `true`.
2. `DateTime` of recurring `Task` has passed current `DateTime`
    * Update the old `DateTime` to a new `DateTime` according to its `Recurrence` type.
    * Mark `Status#isDone` to `false`.
    * `Status#isOverdue` remains `false`.
3. User edits non-recurring overdue `Task` with a passed `DateTime` to a future `DateTime`
    * Mark `Status#isOverdue` to `false`.
4. User edits non-recurring `Task` with a future `DateTime` to a passed `DateTime`
    * Mark `Status#isOverdue` to `true`.

<img src="images/HandleOverdueAndRecurringTasksActivityDiagram.png" width="450"/>

For each `Task` in NurseyBook, it will go through this cycle of checks to ensure their `DateTime` and `Status` are updated accordingly.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find task feature

#### Implementation
These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(predicate)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario which demonstrates how the find task mechanism behaves at each step. The example command is `findTask Pfizer`.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `findTask Pfizer` command to search for a list of tasks whose `Description` contains the keyword `Pfizer`. This prompts the `LogicManager` to start its execution by calling its `execute()` command.

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls the `NurseyBookParser` to parse the command.

Step 3. The `NurseyBookParser` creates a new `FindCommandParser` which will `parse()` the arguments. This creates a new `DescriptionContainsKeywordPredicate` that checks if a `Task`'s `Description` contains the keyword(s) - `Pfizer` in this case. A new `FindTaskCommand` which is ready to be executed is returned, containing the predicate as one of its fields.

Step 4. The `FindTaskCommand` is executed by calling its `execute()` method. This calls the `Model#updateFilteredTaskList()` and updates the filtered task list by checking the tasks with `DescriptionContainsKeywordPredicate`.

Step 5. A new `CommandResult` is returned which switches the display to the filtered task list. The result is returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the find task operation works:

### ViewSchedule Feature

#### Implications on representation of `Task` objects
The `viewSchedule` command introduced a need for certain tasks, specifically future occurrences of recurring tasks, to be visible to the user only when this command is called. Such temporary tasks need to be not visible once the next command is entered.

To achieve this functionality, `Task` objects had to be refactored into`RealTask` and `GhostTask` objects as shown in the diagram below.

![DetailedTaskClassDiagram](./images/DetailedTaskClassDiagram.png)

RealTasks represent concrete tasks, which are either non-recurring tasks, or the current occurrence of recurring tasks.
GhostTasks are temporary tasks that exist for the purpose of allowing the user to preview future occurrences of recurring tasks.
By default, `viewTasks` will only show RealTasks.

#### Handling persistence of `GhostTask` objects
Since `UniqueTaskList` contains `Task` type objects, these objects can be either `GhostTask` or `RealTask` objects. A natural implication of `UniqueTaskList` containing all `Task` type objects would be the persistence of
GhostTasks between different command calls. This becomes a problem in certain situations, as detailed below.

Let us assume that two commands, A and B, are executed, both of which create GhostTasks during their execution, and then display the task list to show the user the GhostTasks created during execution. The following will be observed.

1. Command A is executed.
2. Command A adds GhostTasks to `UniqueTaskList`.
3. Tasks displayed contain GhostTasks created by Command A.
4. Command B is executed.
5. Command B adds GhostTasks to `UniqueTaskList`
6. Tasks displayed contain GhostTasks created by Command B and Command A.

In step 6, it is expected to observe only GhostTasks created during execution of Command B, but GhostTasks created during execution of Command A will also be displayed, since all GhostTasks persist in the main `UniqueTaskList`.
This necessitates a cleanup of `GhostTask` objects between execution of each command. Such deletion of old GhostTasks in the `Model` is achieved just prior to the execution of each new command in `LogicManager`, via the `deleteGhostTasks()` method.

Code snippet of the `execute(String commandText)` method in `LogicManager`:

```
@Override
public CommandResult execute(String commandText) throws CommandException, ParseException {
    logger.info("----------------[USER COMMAND][" + commandText + "]");
    
    //deletes all previous ghost tasks from the model as they are no longer relevant
    model.deleteGhostTasks();
    
    //parsing and execution of command
    CommandResult commandResult;
    Command command = nurseyBookParser.parseCommand(commandText);
    commandResult = command.execute(model);
```

#### Implementation
`ViewScheduleCommand` leverages on this ability to create GhostTasks. The other unique aspect in the implementation of this feature, is how the program figures out which GhostTasks to create and show to the user upon execution of this command.
When a `ViewScheduleCommand` is executed with a given `keyDate`, where `keyDate` refers to the date on which the user wants to view schedule, the method `addPossibleGhostTasksWithMatchingDate(keyDate)` is responsible for this addition of relevant GhostTasks.

Each task in the task list goes through a series of checks and actions before a GhostTask is created.
Given below is an activity diagram that summarizes the sequence of checks and actions taken for each task in the task list upon calling the above-mentioned method.

![AddPossibleGhostTasksWithMatchingDateActivityDiagram](./images/AddPossibleGhostTasksWithMatchingDateActivityDiagram.png)

Since the remaining general mechanisms by which the view schedule operation occurs, such as how the command is parsed and how the `ViewScheduleCommand` is created,  is similar to other previously elaborated commands, a step-by-step elaboration is not given for the overall execution.

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: Differentiating `RealTask` and `GhostTask` Objects**

* **Alternative 1:** Add a new field to `Task` objects that determine whether a task is a real task or not.
    * Pros: Easier to implement and integrate with existing AB3 code
    * Cons: Increased failure points, as an additional field has to be stored in the hard disk to determine if tasks are real or not. This field has to be kept track of in between different commands, but not exposed to the user.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Make `Task` abstract and add concrete `RealTask` and `GhostTask` subclasses to it.
    * Pros: Clearer classification of Task types. Polymorphism can be used to handle `RealTask` and `GhostTask` objects respectively.
    * Cons: All code for existing `Task` objects needs to be refactored. More code needs to be written, which could result in more room for bugs.

Alternative 2 was chosen as although Alternative 1 is simpler to implement, Alternative 1 has poor encapsulation of real and temporary task objects. `GhostTasks` need to be handled differently
from `RealTasks`, as we do not want to expose them to the user. Hence, it makes more sense to encapsulate it as a separate class, even though more code needs to be refactored, written and tested.
This also keeps the data stored in the hard disk smaller, as there is no unnecessary field to keep track of whether a task is real or not.

**Aspect: Searching of future occurrences of recurring tasks**

With recurring tasks, they imply the existence of infinite potential future occurrences. Consequently, users could input dates well beyond reasonable amounts, such as centuries into
the future. However, it is not sensible nor feasible to search for such extraordinary lengths of time. Hence, the maximum amount of time that a user can view schedule on a future date has been
capped at 12 weeks, or 84 days, from the current date. This number was derived based on our estimations on how many weeks nurses would most likely have to plan ahead for in nursing homes, along with some extra leeway.

**Aspect: Viewing of schedule on dates that have passed already**

For viewing schedule on a date that has passed already, there is no issue if the tasks that fall on the date are only non-recurring. The complication arises when recurring tasks are involved.
If we were to potentially implement checking of recurring tasks into the past, that would raise concerns such as whether the task should be marked as overdue or not, and whether it should be marked
as done. Due to too much ambiguity involving the representation of recurring tasks in the past, we have decided to disable the option to view schedule of past dates entirely. In any case,
it does not have much value for the context of NurseyBook's purposes as well.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation
The undo and redo features are facilitated by `VersionedNurseyBook`. It extends `NurseyBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `nurseyBookStateList` and `currentStateIndex`. 
The `VersionedNurseyBook` implements the following operations:

* `VersionedNurseyBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current nursey book state and the latest command result in its history.
* `VersionedNurseyBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous nursey book state from its history and returns the command result of the command undone.
* `VersionedNurseyBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone nursey book state from its history and returns the command result of the command redone.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitNurseyBook()`, `Model#undoNurseyBook()` and `Model#redoNurseyBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The data of the `VersionedNurseyBook` will be initialized with the initial nursey book. 
A new `NurseyBookState` will be created with a copy of the current nursey book and the `INITIAL_COMMAND_RESULT`. 
This initial nursey book state is added to the `nurseyBookStateList`, with the `currentStateIndex` pointing to that initial nursey book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `deleteElderly 5` command to delete the 5th elderly in the nursey book. The `deleteElderly` command calls `Model#commitNurseyBook()`, 
creating a new `NurseyBookState` with a copy of the modified state of the nursey book after the `deleteElderly 5` command executes and the command result of the `deleteElderly 5` command.
This nursey book state is then saved in the `nurseyBookStateList` and the `currentStateIndex` is shifted to the newly inserted nursey book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `addTag 1 t/diabetes` to add a tag to the first elderly in the list. The `addTag` command also calls `Model#commitNurseyBook()`, causing another modified nursey book state to be saved into the `nurseyBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** 
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitNurseyBook()`, so the nursey book state will not be saved into the `nurseyBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the tag to the elderly was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. 
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoNurseyBook()`, which will decrease the `currentStateIndex` by one, causing it to refer to the previous nursey book state, and restores the nursey book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** 
If the `currentStateIndex` is 0, referring to the initial nursey book state, then there are no previous states to restore. 
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoNurseyBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempt to perform the undo.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoNurseyBook()`, which increases the `currentStateIndex` by one to refer to the previously undone state, and restores the nursey book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** 
If the `currentStateIndex` is equal to `nurseyBookStateList.size() - 1`, it is referring to the latest nursey book state, then there are no undone nursey book states to restore. 
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoNurseyBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempt to perform the redo.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `viewElderly`. Commands that do not modify the data of the nursey book, such as `viewElderly`, will not call `Model#commitNurseyBook()`, `Model#undoNurseyBook()` or `Model#redoNurseyBook()`. 
Thus, the `nurseyBookStateList` and `currentStateIndex` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitNurseyBook()`. Since the `currentStateIndex` is not at the end of the `nurseyBookStateList`, all nursey book states after the `currentStateIndex` will be deleted. 
The new modified nursey book state is then saved into the `nurseyBookStateList`
Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `addTag 1 t/diabetes` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: How undo & redo executes**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire nursey book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage as copies of the entire nursey book are saved.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteElderly`, just save the elderly being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

Alternative 1 was chosen as there are many commands that change the data of the nursey book. 
With alternative 1, all these commands will go through the same activity of saving the nursey book state instead of having different activity flow for undoing or redoing each command, making it easier to maintain.

**Aspect: What to save**

* **Alternative 1:** Save only the nursey book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: No information on the commands that changed the data of the nursey book.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Save the nursey book and the command result.
    * Pros: Information on the command that changed the data of the nursey book is saved.
    * Cons: More memory usage as more information needs to be saved and increases dependency between classes.

Alternative 2 was chosen as we feel that it is helpful to store information on the command that changed the data of the nursey book.
This way, when users execute the undo/redo command, information on the command that is being undone/redone is also available and can be shown to the user. 
The relevant user interface is also displayed to the user as the `ListDisplayChange` is in the command result saved. 
For example, when a user undoes an `addElderly` command, the user interface will toggle to the list of elderly based on the command result saved, showing the user the change.

2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 elderlies and 1000 tasks without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Data should be stored locally and without any DBMS.
5.  Should be for a single user, not multiple users.
6.  The system should respond within 2 seconds per search query.

### Glossary

* **DBMS**: Database management systems are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.

## **Appendix C: Effort**

Assuming the effort taken to create AB3 is rated at 100, we would estimate our project to have taken an effort of 200. Numerically, we have over 19000 lines of code contributed for version 1.4 of NurseyBook, with over 550 test cases to achieve high code coverage. 
Below, we have detailed the major time-consuming factors to justify our effort estimation.

### Notable Changes

#### 1. Implementation of Task Management System
Apart from simply evolving the address book from AB3 into an address book for nursing homes, we went the extra mile to implement a task management system to complement the address book. Furthermore, we integrated the features of the task management system with
those of the address book, such as being able to link elderlies from the address book to tasks created. This was an effort made to make our product truly unique and effective in solving the problems faced by our target market. Hence, in effect, we had to develop two
systems within the timeframe, and integrate them to make NurseyBook what it is today.

#### 2. Refactoring of Person and Adding of Task models
In order to support the `Elderly` and `Nok` classes, a refactoring of the `Person` class is needed to accommodate these two kinds of persons.

Moreover, to support task management, our team had to add a model for `Task` objects. While some sections of the code could be adapted from AB3â€™s Person model, the majority had to be redesigned to accommodate complex task creation.

The implementation of AB3â€™s command processing and display of elements, in an UniqueElementList, to the user, means that all elements within that list will be displayed to the user, based on a given predicate. However, for certain commands such as `viewSchedule`, we would want to show the user a preview of future occurrences of recurring tasks. These temporary tasks need to be differentiated from normal concrete tasks. Thus, this necessitated the further refactoring of  `Task` into an abstract class, with concrete `GhostTask` and `RealTask` child classes. This restructuring of how task objects are represented gives our program the capacity to accommodate for previewing of tasks, without saving them to the hard disk or flooding the `UniqueTaskList`.

As a result, we had to integrate all these models with the existing code to save persons and tasks to a data file in NurseyBook. This required the creation of many classes and major refactoring of existing classes to support multiple models.

#### 3. Redesigned GUI
Compared to AB3, NurseyBook has nearly double the number of UI components.

We had played around with multiple colour schemes, to find something that could strike a perfect balance between 1) healthcare related, 2) matching colours, 3) colours to stand out for our tags (e.g. tags added to each elderly, overdue tags for tasks).

Next, though we wanted to keep NurseyBook as close to a command line interface (CLI) as possible, we had added a few listeners to allow navigation within NurseyBook with a mouse. One example will be the expandable details for an elderly, when the user is on the elderly list view.

Additionally, each of the UI components is responsive and works on a large range of screen sizes. We took multiple tries to make sure that the display of elderly contacts could be easily viewed despite the variation in the window size of the application used.

Furthermore, to allow for a better user experience, we restricted the scrolling of components to be either horizontal or vertical. We wanted to offer a cleaner user interface and better user experience through easy to use features, especially for our busy target users - nurses working in nursing homes.

#### 4. Undo/Redo
The implementation of the `undo` and `redo` features in NurseyBook was adapted from the [SE-EDU AddressBook Level 4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4). However, we wanted our undo/redo feature to show users what command is being undone/redone. This meant that we had to modify the implementation such that the command result of the commands are also saved. The modification allows NurseyBook to display the command message of the command being undone or redone, giving users more information on what is the change in data. Furthermore, for commands that switch to display a particular list, we have implemented it such that undoing or redoing such commands will also change the list displayed. For example, undoing an `addTask` command will cause the task list to be displayed.

In addition, as the undo/redo feature was implemented at a later stage, there were many changes to be made to existing commands and test cases. Methods to save the changes to the data of the NurseyBook had to be added to the execution of commands that change the data and their test cases.
