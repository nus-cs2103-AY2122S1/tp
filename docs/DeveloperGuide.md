### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [**`Reminder`**](#reminder-component): Runs on a background thread in checking upcoming birthdays and displaying reminder alerts.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`BirthdayListPanel`, `FriendListPanel`, `ProfileDisplay`, `FriendWindow` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands as well as listen to the `Reminder` component.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.
* depends on a functional interface in the `Reminder` component, because the `UI` updates the `Reminder` component on reminder changes. 

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/FriendBookLogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FriendBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram (simplified) below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/FriendBookDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/FriendBookParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FriendBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `FriendBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/model/Model.java)

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the friend book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
	* 2 copies of the `UniquePersonList` containing the exact same `Person` objects are used. The only difference is the ordering of the `Person` objects in each of the lists, where one list functions as a contact list and the other functions as a birthday list which is sorted based on earliest birthday.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences, which includes the border sizes of the app and the profile name. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a `Reminder` object which is associated to a `Person` object. Note that this `Reminder` is functionally different from the `Reminder` component. The `Reminder` object in the `Model` component is simply a class to store the details of a `Reminder` and to ascertain if a `Person` has his/her `Reminder` enabled.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FriendBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `FriendBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both friend book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `FriendBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Reminder component
**API** : [`Reminder.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/reminder/Reminder.java)

<img src="images/ReminderClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

How the `Reminder` component works,
* Runs every 12 hour starting with a 10second delay on application opening in the background.
* Under `ReminderManager` class, it will check birthdays that upcoming in a week or less.
* Displays an alert for the upcoming birthdays to notify user.
* Relies on some methods in the `Logic` component (because the `UI` component's job is to allow user to enable/disable reminders.)
* depends on the `Person` class in order to display relevant information in the alert.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.friendbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Reminder Feature

#### Implementation

Below is a sequence diagram of how the Reminder feature is initialised.
![initialisation of Reminder feature](images/ReminderInitialisationSequenceDiagram.png)


The reminder mechanism is facilitated by the [`ReminderManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/reminder/ReminderManager.java) class.
It extends to an internal JavaFX java library [`ScheduledService`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/concurrent/ScheduledService.html),
which executes tasks in the background without affecting UI thread.

The `ReminderManager` class executes a task which checks for upcoming birthdays that are coming in a week or less
and user wishes to have these friends' birthday to be reminded.

The implementation relies on the `Model` for its birthday list. For every change in the birthday list,
results in the `ReminderManger` class restarting the task to get the latest version of the birthday list. It does so by adding a
listener to the birthday list.

The way the list is updated relies on the `Logic` component and `UI` component.
In the `BirthdayCard`class and `MainWindow` class under `UI` component, which makes use of an functional
interface [`SetRemindExecutor`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/20bd196ca06820b425556ab4dc57dfcd5924a563/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/reminder/ReminderManager.java#L122)
in `ReminderManager` class for every update in the reminder checkbox in `BirthdayCard.java`.

For every change in the reminder checkbox in `BirthdayCard` class, [`LogicManager#executeUpdateReminder(Person, Person)`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/blob/20bd196ca06820b425556ab4dc57dfcd5924a563/src/main/java/seedu/friendbook/logic/LogicManager.java#L62) method
updates the birthday list which then results in the listener in the `ReminderManager` class to restart the background task.

If there exists a birthday that is less than a week or less, and user wishes for that birthday to be reminded, a popup alert will display
a message of all friends that have birthdays coming in a week or less.

Below is another sequence diagram showing a scenario of when a reminder checkbox is updated by the user:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch
	
	1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder 
	
	2. Double-click the jar file.<br> Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences
	
	1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
	
	2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br> Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

3. Exiting the app
	
	1. User has previously entered commands which would have modified data to be different compared to the data at the start of the current session
	
	2. Exit the app either by force terminating it, or entering the command `exit`. <br> Expected: GUI window closes. All changes made are saved to the data file and will reflect the latest modified version upon the next session. User preferences are saved as well.




### Adding a person

1. Adding a person
	
	1. Test case: `add 1` <br> Expected: No person is added. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
	
	2. Test case: `Add 1` <br> Expected: No person is added. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
	
	3. Test case: `add n/James Lim` <br> Expected: No person is added. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
	
	4. Test case: `add n/James lim p/1234567890 e/jameslime@example.com b/1995-05-23` <br> Expected: `James Lim` is added to the list and immediately reflected. Details of the newly added contact is shown in the status message.
	
	5. Test case: Enter the command `add n/Markus lim p/99995555 e/marclim@example.com b/1996-06-24` twice. <br> Expected: The 1st command succeeds if the contact to add does not already exist in the list, adding him the the list. The 2nd command fails and error details are shown in the status message.


### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown
