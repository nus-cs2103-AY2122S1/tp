## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteStudent 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of multiple parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ListPanelPlaceholder`, `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow` etc. These parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `XYZListPanel` is in turn made up of other parts e.g. `StudentListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `GroupListPanel`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands and to determine the type of object to display in the `ListPanelPlaceholder`.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays either a `Student`, `Group`, or `Task` object residing in the `Model`.

#### XYZListPanel Component

The `XYZListPanel` consists of either a `StudentListPanel`, `TaskListPanel` or `GroupListPanel`.

Each of these `XYZListPanel`s consists of their own `XYZCard` components which make up the final GUI.

The layout of these `XYZListPanel`s are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteStudent 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteStudent 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student`, `Group` or `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList`, `UniqueGroupList`, `UniqueTaskList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

The class diagrams of the `Student`, `Task` and `Group` classes are shown below:

#### Task Component

![Structure of the Task Class](images/TaskClassDiagram.png)

tApp allows TAs to manage their tasks for his or her professional or personal use.

The different types of lists include:
1. Todo Tasks - Just a task to be completed in the future
2. Deadline - A task to be completed in the future by a specified deadline
3. Event - A task to be completed on a specified date

Common commands for the task model:

* `addTask` - Creates a new task item
* `editTask` - Modifies an existing task
* `deleteTask` - Removes an existing task from the list of tasks
* `markTask` - Updates the status of a task item
* `tasks` - Shows all tasks in the list
* `clearTasks` - Removes all the tasks in the list

##### Rationale

The tApp is supposed to cater to TA, who are very busy. They have their own modules to prepare for and as well as prepare for weekly tutorial sessions. Hence, they have lots of things to keep track and a task manager feature is necessary. And there are primarily 3 types of tasks - todos, deadlines and events. tApp has supports all of these features to assist TAs in performing their tasks more efficiently and accurately.

##### Current Implementation

To adhere to Object-Oriented Programming principles, we have decided to make the `Task` class as an abstract parent class and `TodoTasks`, `DeadlineTask` and `EventTask` classes a subclass of `Task` class.

The `Task` class, and all its subclasses,

* stores information regarding a user's task as shown above.
* stores a compulsory reference to a `TaskName` object, a `Priority` enumeration field, and a boolean `isDone` field.
* stores an optional reference to a `Description` object.
* stores `Tag`, which is a class common to the `Student` and `Group` data types.

In addition to the components above, the `EventTask` and `DeadlineTask` classes store a compulsory reference to a `TaskDate` object.


#### Student and Group Component

![Structure of the Student and Group Class](images/StudentGroupClassDiagram.png)

The `Student` component,

* stores the student's personal information as shown by composition in the diagram above.
* stores `Tag` and `RepoName` which are classes common to both `Student` and `Group` data types. `RepoName` in this case refers to the name of the student's IP repository.
* stores a reference to the `Group` the student is a part of via a unique `groupName` from the `Group` component (composition is not valid here as a `Group` can exist with an empty `Member` component). This attribute is not modifiable via teh regular `editStudent` command, and can only be modified internally when the student is added/deleted from a `Group`, or the `GroupName` of the student's group changes.

The `Group` component,

* stores group related information, similarly shown by composition in the diagram above.
* stores `Tag` and `RepoName`. In this case, `RepoName` refers to the TP repository of the group.
* has a `Members` subcomponent that stores references to the `Student` component. This is initialized with no references to any `Student` to allow for preemptive creation of groups before members are made known. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `XYZ` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `XYZ` object needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find Command

The find command is generalised for two main groups of data in tApp: students and groups.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.
In this example, we explore the `findStudent` command.

The following diagram shows the workflow of a typical FindStudent command.

![Activity Diagram of Find Student](images/FindStudentActivityDiagram.png)

When the user executes the `findStudent` command, the user input is parsed to separate the command and its arguments. Special characters are removed during this parsing step. Students are then searched based on the specified arguments.
During the execution of `FindStudentCommand`, the student list will be filtered based on the predicate created from the arguments.

The following steps describes the execution of the FindStudent command, assuming no errors are encountered.

1. The user executes a `findStudent alex ber` command to find students whose names contain the name word `alex` or `ber`.
1. `LogicManager` handles this command by calling its `execute(String)` method.
1. `LogicManager` then calls and passes this command to `AddressBookParser` to parse the command through its `parseCommand(String)` method.
1. The `AddressBookParser` creates a new `FindStudentCommandParser` which will parse the arguments `parse(alex ber)`. This in turns create a new `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` instance that checks if a `Student` contains the predicates `alex` or `ber`.
1. A new `FindStudentCommand` is created by `FindStudentCommandParser` and is returned to `LogicManager` with the predicate as one of its fields.
1. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method in `FindStudentCommand`.
1. The `FindStudentCommand` calls the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` method, passing in the previously returned predicate as its argument.
1. The filtered student list is updated by checking all the students in the filtered students list with the `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` instance.
1. In this case, the filtered student list should return the students: Alex and Bernice as in the sample data.
1. A new `CommandResult` is returned, switching the current display to the filtered student list. The result is returned to `LogicManager`.

The above process is further summarised in the following sequence diagram:

![Sequence Diagram of Find Student](images/FindStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindStudentCommandParser`, `FindStudentCommand`, `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` should end at the Destroy Marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


#### Design Considerations

How can we improve search for a student?

* **Alternative 1 (selected implementation):**
    * Allow user to search through partial names. This is done through an `anyMatch` using any part of (`contains`) `String` predicate.
    * *Pros:* Easier to implement, more convenient since there are no prefixes. Generally, this method results in a better user experience, since the user may not be exactly sure what the student name is if it is a complicated name.
    * *Cons:* No search by different fields, e.g. email.

* **Alternative 2**:
    * Allow search of students through different fields with multiple prefixes.
    * *Pros:* More freedom to find a student based on different fields.
    * *Cons:* Increases complexity in software.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Mark Attendance/Participation/Task-as-Done Command

The mark command is generalised for two main groups of data in tApp: students and tasks.
These commands can be accessed through `marka`, `markp` for students, and `doneTask` for tasks.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the marking mechanism behaves at each step.
In this example, we explore the `marka` command.

1. When the user executes the `marka` command, the user input is parsed to separate the command and its arguments.
1. The format of the command is first checked, followed by the checking and separation of the individual arguments (student index(es) and week). This is done in the `MarkStudentAttCommandParser#parse(String args)` method.
1. The student's attendance status for the particular week is retrieved and toggled. This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#markStudentAttendance(Student student, int week)`.
1. If the student is originally marked as absent, the method toggles his attendance to present.
1. If the student is originally marked as present, the method toggles his attendance to absent.
1. If the student belongs to a group, the group's student list will be updated with the updated student.
1. Steps 3 to 6 are repeated for the next student, until all the specified students' attendance are toggled.
1. A new `CommandResult` is returned, switching the current display to the updated student list. 
1. Note: An error message will be thrown if: student index out of bounds, duplicate student index in the command, invalid week, invalid command format, invalid type of argument.

During the execution of `MarkStudentAttCommand`, the student list will be updated according to the arguments supplied.

The following diagram shows the summarised workflow of a typical `marka` command.

![Activity Diagram of Mark Student Attendance Command](images/MarkStudentAttActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

How can we improve the marking of attendance of a student?

* **Alternative 1 (selected implementation):**
    * Toggle the attendance when the `marka` command is executed for the student.
    * *Pros:* More intuitive for the user, just call the command to mark the attendance. Easier to implement, more convenient since there are no prefixes/flags. 
    * *Cons:* May accidentally mark the attendance wrongly (e.g. present to absent).

* **Alternative 2**:
    * Use of flags `-p` (present), `-a` (absent) to mark attendance
    * *Pros:* Less confusing for the user when there is a larger set of students (>100). Lesser risk of mis-marking a user.
    * *Cons:* Increases complexity, more flags for user to remember.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add Member to Group Command

The add member command can be executed to form an association between two main data types in tApp, Groups and Students.

#### Implementation

![Sequence Diagram of Add Member](images/AddMemberSequenceDiagram.png)

As with all other commands in tApp, the addMember feature is activated when a user enters the `addMember` command word followed by its relevant arguments.
The main difference between the addMember command lies not in the way the `Logic` class is activated but in the way the `Model` class processes this command.

When the user executes the `addMember` command, user input is parsed and the `Index` of student to be added, and the `GroupName` of the group to be added to are extracted into parameters of the `AddMemberCommand` class.

If any errors are present in the user input, exceptions are thrown in the following components, summarised in the following activity diagram:

![Activity Diagram of Add Member](images/AddMemberActivityDiagram.png)

1. `AddMemberCommandParser` throws an exception if command format is invalid (negative/missing index, missing group prefix)
1. `AddMemberCommand` throws an exception if the `Index` does not exist in the student list, `GroupName` is does not belong to any preexisting `Group`. It also throws an exception if the student is already in another group, or the student has already been added to the current group. 
The workflow for throwing these exceptions is similar to the first two and is not shown in the activity diagram below.

The interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` classes are shown in the following sequence diagram:

![Reference Sequence Diagram of Add Member](images/AddMemberRefSequenceDiagram.png)

A key difference to note about this command is that it gets a list of both `Students` and `Groups` from models, instead of only 1 list as per other commands.

The follow steps describes the execution of the AddMember command:

1. `AddMemberCommand` uses the provided `Index` and `GroupName` to obtain both a reference to the `Student` (using `Index`) and the `Group` (using `GroupName`). Since `GroupName` is unique, there will only be one `Group` selected.
1. `AddMemberCommand` then uses these references to call the `addMembers` function of the `Model` class.
1. The `Model` then creates and stores a new `Student` using the same information as the `Student` parameter passed in, but substituting the `GroupName` field to the name of the `Group` passed as a parameter.
1. `Model` then calls the `addMember` function of the referenced `Group`, passing in the newly created `Student` as a parameter.
1. `Group` then calls the `addMember` function of its `Member` class, passing in the same `Student` parameter.
1. The `Member` then stores a reference to this `Student`.
1. `Model` then calls `setStudent` and `setGroup` to update these changes in `AddressBook`.
1. Execution of this command then follows the usual execution path of all other commands in tApp.

Unlike other commands which only changes itself in the `Model` class, `addMembers` updates both the `Student` to be added and the `Group` to which the student is added to, and saves both these changes in the `AddressBook`.

#### Design considerations:

* Alternative 1 (selected implementation): Have `Members` save a list of `Student` and `Student` have a reference to `GroupName`
    * Pros: Easy to implement, all relevant student information can be readily accessed and displayed in the GUI.
    * Cons: Increases coupling between `Student` and `Group` classes.

* Alternative 2: Have `Members` save the `Name` of students and `Student` have a reference to `Group`
    * Pros: Smaller JSON file size due to smaller volume of information being referenced to.
    * Cons: Increases coupling between `Student` and `Group` classes, need to find the relevant `Student` object given its `Name` everytime the `Group` is to be displayed in the GUI,
      unnatural modelling of the real world since `Group` contains students and not the other way around.

* Alternative 3: Have `Members` save the `Name` of students only
    * Pros: Smaller JSON file size due to smaller volume of information being referenced to, lesser coupling due to only a unidirectional association.
    * Cons: Unable to display the `GroupName` of a `Student` in the student display list using simple code implementation, reduction in input validation capabilities (assigning 1 student to 2 groups) since there is no direct way to determine if a `Student` is already in a group.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


### Edit Group Command

#### Implementation
![Sequence Diagram of EditGroupCommand](images/EditGroupCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The Edit Group feature is activated when a user enters the `editGroup` command word followed by its relevant arguments.
When the user executes the `editGroup` command, user input is parsed and the fields to be edited are extracted into an `EditGroupDescriptor` object.
The `EditGroupDescriptor` object and the `Index` of the group to be edited are then extracted into parameters of the `EditGroupCommand` class.
The `EditGroupCommand` then interacts with the `Model` class to edit the data.

The implementations of the other Edit commands, namely the `EditTaskCommand` and the `EditStudentCommand`, are similar to the `EditGroupCommand` in the way the `Logic` component behaves.
However, the behaviour of the `Model` component differs slightly for the `EditGroupCommand`, as it alters not only the `Group` data, but also the `Student` data in the `AddressBook`.

This process is shown in the following sequence diagram:

![Reference Sequence Diagram of EditGroupCommand](images/EditGroupCommandRefSequenceDiagram.png)

The following steps describe the execution of the `EditGroupCommand`.

1. `EditGroupCommand` uses the provided `Index` and `EditGroupDescriptor` to create the updated `Group` object.
2. `EditGroupCommand` calls the `setGroup` method of the `Model` class to replace the previous `Group` object with the newly updated one.
3. `Model` then updates all `Student` objects that are part of the `Members` class of the group. This is achieved by creating new `Student` objects that have a reference to the `GroupName` of the updated group, and calling the `setStudent` method of `AddressBook` to update the `Student data`.
4. Finally, `Model` calls the `setGroup` function of the `AddressBook` to update the `Group` data of the `AddressBook`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit Task Command

#### Implementation
![Sequence Diagram of EditTaskCommand](images/EditTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The Edit Task feature is activated when a user enters the `editTask` command word followed by its relevant arguments.
When the user executes the `editTask` command, user input is parsed and the fields to be edited are extracted into an `EditTaskDescriptor` object.
The `EditTaskDescriptor` object and the `Index` of the task to be edited are then extracted into parameters of the `EditTaskCommand` class.
The `EditTaskCommand` then interacts with the `Model` class to edit the data.

The implementations of the other Edit commands, namely the `EditGroupCommand` and the `EditStudentCommand`, are similar to the `EditTaskCommand` in the way the `Logic` component behaves.
However, the behaviour of the `Model` component differs slightly for the `EditTaskCommand`, as it alters only the `Task` data in the `AddressBook`.

This process is shown in the following sequence diagram:

![Reference Sequence Diagram of EditTaskCommand](images/EditTaskCommandRefSequenceDiagram.png)

The following steps describe the execution of the `EditTaskCommand`.

1. `EditTaskCommand` uses the provided `Index` and `EditTaskDescriptor` to create the updated `Task` object.
2. `EditTaskCommand` then calls the `setTask` method of the `Model` class to replace the previous `Task` object with the newly updated one.
3. Finally, `Model` calls the `setTask` function of the `AddressBook` to update the `Task` data.


### Adding Todo Task

Given below is an example usage scenario of adding a todo task 
and how the adding a todo task mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes the `todo n/Complete tp p/H t/CS2103 t/Work` to add a Todo Task named 'Complete tp' with the tags
   'CS2103' and 'Work' to the list of tasks and marks this task as High Priority.
2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute(String)`, which then calls and passes this command to the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)` method.
3. The `AddressBookParser` detects the command word `todo` in the string and extracts the argument string `n/Complete tp p/H t/CS2103 t/Work`.
4. The `AddressBookParser` creates a new `AddTodoTaskCommandParser` instance to parse the argument string according to the format specified for `AddTodoTaskCommand`.
5. The argument string is parsed to create new tags and keep them in a `Set<Tags>` and the Priority of the task is set to high. These are done using the `AddTodoTaskCommandParser#parse(String)` method, which also performs validation.
6. The `AddTodoTaskCommandParser` creates a new `AddTodoTaskCommand` and returns it to AddressBookParser, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.
7. The LogicManager calls the `AddTodoTaskCommand#execute(Model)` method.
8. The AddTodoTaskCommand calls the `Model#addTask(Task)` method.
9. The task is added to the list of tasks and the updated list of task is displayed.
9. Lastly, the `AddTodoTaskCommand` creates a `CommandResult` with a success message and returns it to `LogicManager`.

The above process is shown in the following sequence diagram:

![Reference Sequence Diagram of AddTodoTaskCommand](images/AddTodoTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

### Non-Functional Requirements
* Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
* Should be able to hold up to 100 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
* A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
* Commands used should be intuitive, and should not exceed 80 characters.
* System should respond almost immediately (max: 3 seconds) upon entering a command.
* Error messages shown should inform the user of what is wrong and what the correct command syntax should be.


### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Student**: A student contact.
* **Group**: A CS2103 group consisting of multiple members, which are student contacts.
* **Task**: A todo task, a deadline task (task with a deadline) or an event task (task with an event date).
* **Directory**: The list of students, groups or tasks.
* **Invalid**: An input is invalid when it does not follow the correct command input format. Inputs are also invalid if executing a command with that input would result in duplicate data items (`Student`, `Group`, or `Task`) in the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Effort**
Our team has put in a significant amount of effort into making our application cater to the needs of CS2103/T Teaching Assistants. While AB3 had only dealt with the `Person` entity type, tApp stores data of 3 different entity types, `Task`, `Student` and `Group`.
Implementing this required a deep understanding of how AB3 was structured and implemented, in order to expand on its functionality.
Moreover, classes such as `Student` and `Group` interact in order to provide more utility to the user, adding another layer of difficulty to the implementation.

In addition, our group has added many commands in addition to the ones implemented by AB3. While AB3 had a total of 8 available commands, tApp has a total of 27 in order to accommodate for all the different entity types and features.
This required significant time and effort, as well as a good understanding of the `Logic` component of AB3. We also made significant changes to the UI, making it more appropriate
for this app, such as the introduction of the different colours for the different tags.
