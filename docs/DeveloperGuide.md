## Introduction to Socius

Socius is a desktop application that helps CS2103T Software Engineering students, to
* manage classmates’ contacts,
* make friends, and
* find teammates!

The Socius Developer Guide gets you learn how Socius works.
This Developer Guide familarises you with the commands and functionality of Socius, enabling you to build on Socius.

We hope that you will have a great time learning about Socius! :)

Socius provides these main features:
* Access details of students taking CS2103T.
* Find any student with their name, tutorial group, nationality, tags, and more.
* Pin suitable tags to categorize students.
* View statistics on nationality.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
Socius is optimized for use via a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. If you can
type fast, Socius can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional *GUI* apps.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of Socius.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At Socius launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of Socius.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of Socius in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("edit 1 n/Amy")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit n/Amy` Command](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation of Features**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a person `add`

#### Implementation

The add mechanism is facilitated by AddCommand and AddCommandParser. It allows users to add contacts by name alone,
without the need to include other contact details.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the AddCommand mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user first launches Socius and adds a new contact by name, without any other contact details.

Step 2. The user executes the command "add n/[NAME]" to add a new person with no contact details.

Step 3. The `parse` function of AddCommandParser will parse the input and set the optional arguments as empty strings, before
   instantiating a new `Person` object.

Step 4. The command communicates with the `Model` to add the person to the existing AddressBook.

Step 5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddCommand function works:

![UpdatedAddCommandSeqDiagram](images/AddCommandDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an AddCommand:

![UpdatedAddCommand](images/UpdatedAddCommand.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How contacts are saved with optional arguments:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save a contact, with empty strings as arguments if argument is not included in
  input.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May result in unexpected bugs.

* **Alternative 2:** Save all optional attributes of a contact as Optional type.
    * Pros: Will result in fewer unexpected bugs since input is expected to be optional.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.

### Adding tags to people `addt`

#### Implementation

The add tag mechanism is facilitated by AddTagCommand and AddTagCommandParser. It allows users to add tags to a person 
in their contact list by specifying the person's index number and the tags to add.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the remark mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `addt 1 t/friend` command to add the 'friend' tag to the first person in the displayed contact list.

Step 1.1. Alternatively, the user may execute `addt all t/friend` command to add the 'friend' tag to everybody in the displayed
contact list.

Step 2. `AddTagCommandParser#parse` will then parse the arguments provided. A new `AddTagCommand` object will be created after parsing.

The following sequence diagram briefly shows how the AddTagCommandParser operation works:

![RemarkParserSequenceDiagram](images/RemarkParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. The `AddTagCommand` will then create a new `Person` using information from input tag. All other information will be taken from the original `Person`.

Step 4. `AddTagCommand#execute` will then replace the original `Person` in the `model` with the new `Person`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddTagCommand mechanism works:

![UpdatedAddTagCommandSeqDiagram](images/AddCommandDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to support adding tags for one person and for everyone within AddTagCommand:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** When the user enters 'addt all...', the parser will take Index as null.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May result in unexpected bugs.

* **Alternative 2:** Create two different classes for each function.
    * Pros: Will result in fewer unexpected bugs since the logic is more straightforward to the developer.
    * Cons: Less user-friendly as multiple commands have very similar functionalities.

### Editing a person `edit`

#### Implementation

The edit mechanism is facilitated by EditCommand and EditCommandParser. It allows users to edit any contact details of a person
in their contact list by the index number shown in their displayed contact list.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a edit command on a specified person:

![EditActivityDiagram](images/RemarkActivityDiagram.png)

The edit mechanism will edit any contact details of the person specified by a given index. If the edited person already exists, the edit command will throw an exception.

During `EditCommand#execute`, a new `Person` object will be created. The values will remain the same for all of a person contact details (e.g. `Name`) except for those which are specified for change.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `edit 1 n/Alice` command to edit the name of first person in the displayed contact list to 'Alice'.

Step 2. `EditCommandParser#parse` will then parse the arguments provided. A new `EditCommand` object will be created after parsing.

The following sequence diagram briefly shows how the EditCommandParser operation works:

![RemarkParserSequenceDiagram](images/RemarkParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. The `EditCommand` will then create a new `Person` using information from input arguments. All other information will be taken from the original `Person`.

Step 4. `EditCommand#execute` will then replace the original `Person` in the `model` with the new `Person`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the EditCommand mechanism works:

![RemarkSequenceDiagram](images/RemarkSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not be saved in Socius, so the person's contact details in Socius will not be updated.
</div>

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `Person` with their contact details replaced and the other contact details same as the original `Person`.
    * Pros: Maintains immutability.
    * Cons: It may have performance issues in terms of memory usage as a new `Person` object is created.

* **Alternative 2:** Edit the original `Person` directly.
    * Pros: It uses less memory and thus may run faster.
    * Cons: If the execution is stopped halfway, then the newly updated person will contain wrong information. It will also be difficult to debug.

### Support for multiple social handles

#### Implementation
A social handle can store a social platform and a user ID tied to that platform.

As a person may have multiple social handles for different social platforms, there is a need to support multiple social handles tied to a person.

The approach to implementing multiple social handles is similar to the original AB3's approach to implementing multiple tags. A Java HashSet is used to store all the social handle objects of a person.

The current implementation allows for each person to have only 1 social handle for each platform. Therefore, when parsing social handles, new user ID will overwrite old user ID of the same social platform. This is done by using a Java Hashtable to store all the original social platforms in a platform name to social handle object pair, then check if the social platform of new social handle is present in the hashtable, and then update accordingly. After all the updates, the values of the hashtable are converted into a set to be store under an attribute of a person.

#### Usage
Social handles can be introduced to a person via the 'add' or 'edit' command.

Given a user wants to change the following entry:
![SocialHandleBeforeAfterEdit](images/dg/SocialHandleBeforeAfter.png)

Given below demonstrates how the social handle mechanism would behave at each step.

Step 1: The user enters the command `edit 1 s/tg:alex777 s/ig:a_lex_123 s/tw:alexxx00`

Step 2: `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` will be called to do the first round of parsing to find the type of command being used.

Step 3: After finding the command used is Edit, `EditCommandParser#parse` will be called to further parse the command.

Step 4: `EditCommandParser#parse` will call `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize` to get an `ArgumentMultimap` object, which contains parsed values of all the prefixes.

Step 5: `ArgumentMultimap#GetAllValues` is then called to get a list of values with social handle prefix `s/`.

Step 6: `ParserUtil#parseSocialHandles` is then used to parse the string value of social handles into a set of `SocialHandle` objects.

Step 7: `EditCommand` object is then created and updated with all the change needed to a person.

Step 8: `LogicManager` will then execute the `EditCommand`

Step 9: This will update the relevant person with the new data

The following sequence diagram shows how the EditCommand function works for social handles:
![EditCommandSeqDiagramForSocialHandle](images/dg/EditCommandDiagramForSocialHandle.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to store social handle**
* **Alternative 1:** Store each social handle for each platform as an individual attribute of a person
    * Pros: The logic will be easier to test.
    * Cons: There will be many duplicated code as each social handles are similar.
* **Alternative 2 (Current):** Store a person's social handles as a set.
    * Pros: It will be neater and less time-consuming to implement. Supporting additional platforms will only requires little code change.
    * Cons: It may be more complicated to test.
    
### Deleting a person `delete`

#### Implementation

The delete mechanism is facilitated by DeleteCommand and DeleteCommandParser. It allows users to delete a person
in their contact list by the index number shown in their displayed contact list.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the DeleteCommand mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `delete 1` command to delete the first person in the displayed contact list from the displayed contact list.

Step 2. `DeleteCommandParser#parse` will then parse the index provided. A new `DeleteCommand` object will be created after parsing.

Step 4. The command communicates with the `Model` to delete the person from the existing AddressBook.

Step 5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the DeleteCommand function works:

![UpdatedAddCommandSeqDiagram](images/AddCommandDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an DeleteCommand:

![UpdatedAddCommand](images/UpdatedAddCommand.png)

### Adding a remark to people `remark`

#### Implementation

The remark mechanism is facilitated by RemarkCommand and RemarkCommandParser. It allows users to add a remark to a person
in their contact list by the index number shown in their displayed contact list.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a remark command on a specified person:

![RemarkActivityDiagram](images/RemarkActivityDiagram.png)

The remark mechanism will add a remark to a person specified by a given index. If a remark already exists, the new remark will overwrite the old remark.

During `RemarkCommand#execute`, a new `Person` object will be created. The values will remain the same for all of a person contact details (e.g. `Name`) except for `Remark`.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the remark mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `remark 1 r/She likes coding` command to add a remark to the first person in the displayed contact list.

Step 2. `RemarkCommandParser#parse` will then parse the arguments provided. A new `RemarkCommand` object will be created after parsing.

The following sequence diagram briefly shows how the RemarkCommandParser operation works:

![RemarkParserSequenceDiagram](images/RemarkParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. The `RemarkCommand` will then create a new `Person` using information from input remark. All other information will be taken from the original `Person`.

Step 4. `RemarkCommand#execute` will then replace the original `Person` in the `model` with the new `Person`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the RemarkCommand mechanism works:

![RemarkSequenceDiagram](images/RemarkSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not be saved in Socius, so the person's contact details in Socius will not be updated.
</div>

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `Person` with their remark replaced and the other contact details same as the original `Person`.
    * Pros: Maintains immutability.
    * Cons: It may have performance issues in terms of memory usage as a new `Person` object is created.

* **Alternative 2:** Edit the original `Person` directly.
    * Pros: It uses less memory and thus may run faster.
    * Cons: If the execution is stopped halfway, then the newly updated person will contain wrong information. It will also be difficult to debug.

### Delete multiple people `deletem`

#### Implementation

The delete multiple people mechanism will delete contacts specified by a given set of keywords. Any contacts containing **all** the specified keywords will be deleted.

It works by filtering for the contacts in the `model` and deleting them one by one.

#### Usage

The following activity diagram briefly summarizes what happens when a user executes the `DeleteMultipleCommand` to delete contacts by keywords:

![DeleteMultipleActivityDiagram](images/DeleteMultipleActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the deleting multiple person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `deletem t/friends g/m` command to delete all contacts with the tag `friends` and gender `M`.

Step 3. This will call `DeleteMultipleCommandParser#parse` which will then parse the arguments provided.
Within `DeleteMultipleCommandParser#parse`, `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `GenderContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be created using the tags and gender. These will then be added into the list of predicates.

Step 4. A new `DeleteMultipleCommand` object will be created with its `predicate` set to the one defined in the previous step.
The following sequence diagram briefly shows how the parser operation works (`MultiplePredicates` not shown):

![DeleteMultipleParserSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteMultipleParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. `DeleteMultipleCommand#execute` will filter the model with the provided list of predicates and get back the filtered list.

Step 6. It will then iterate through the list and call `deletePerson` to remove contact with matching keywords one by one.

Step 7. After deleting contacts, it will call `updateFilteredPersonList` on model to list all the remaining contacts.

The following sequence diagram shows how the deleting multiple person mechanism works:

![DeleteMultipleSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteMultipleSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes multiple contacts from the list given multiple keywords.
    * Pros: Convenient for user to mass delete contacts with one command instead of removing one by one.
    * Cons: Challenging to implement as it requires parsing and checking multiple dynamic parameters. It also may have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes multiple contacts from the list given a single keyword.
    * Pros: Less overlapping and easier to debug. It also uses less memory and thus may run faster.
    * Cons: Reduced flexibility for users when deleting contacts as they can only input one single keyword.

### Delete tags from people `deletet`

#### Implementation

The delete tag mechanism is facilitated by DeleteTagCommand and DeleteTagCommandParser. It allows users to delete tags from a person
in their contact list by specifying the person's index number and the tags to add.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `deletet 1 t/friend` command to delete the 'friend' tag from the first person in the displayed contact list.
If the person does not has the 'friend' tag, the DeleteTagCommand throws an exception.

Step 1.1. Alternatively, the user may execute `deletet all t/friend` command to delete the 'friend' tag from everyone in the displayed
contact list. If no one has the 'friend' tag, the DeleteTagCommand throws an exception.

Step 2. `DeleteTagCommandParser#parse` will then parse the arguments provided. A new `DeleteTagCommand` object will be created after parsing.

The following sequence diagram briefly shows how the DeleteTagCommandParser operation works:

![RemarkParserSequenceDiagram](images/RemarkParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. The command communicates with the `Model` to delete the person from the existing AddressBook.

Step 4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the DeleteTagCommand mechanism works:

![UpdatedAddTagCommandSeqDiagram](images/AddCommandDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to support adding tags for one person and for everyone within AddTagCommand:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `deletet all` command should fail only if no one has the specified tag to delete.
    * Pros: Intuitive.
    * Cons: May result in unintentional deletion of tags for the careless user.

* **Alternative 2:** The `deletet all` command should pass only if everyone has the specified tag to delete.
    * Pros: Minimise unintentional deletion of tags.
    * Cons: Less user-friendly, since the user have to make sure all users that are considered must carry that tag to delete.
    
### Sorting people `sort`

#### Implementation

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a sort persons command with a specified field:

![SortActivityDiagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)

The sort mechanism sorts persons based on the specified field in ascending order.
The command will result in the creation of a Comparator<Person>.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `sort n/` command to sort all persons by name in ascending alphabetical order.

Step 3. This will call SortCommandParser#parse which will then parse the arguments provided.

Step 4. A new `NameComparator` and `SortCommand` object will then be created. It will be used to sort all the persons based on their names. This `NameComparator` is then passed to the `SortCommand`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the parser operation works (`NameComparator` not shown):

![SortParserSequenceDiagram](images/SortParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. `SortCommand#execute` will set the `AddressBook` model's sorted person list with the provided comparator.

Step 6. The GUI will then proceed to get the full list of persons.

Step 7. After execution, `CommandResult` will contain a message indicating that it has sorted all persons based on the specified field.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort mechanism works:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort all persons based on single field.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May not be very convenient if the contact list is very huge and users would like to sort based on multiple fields.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort all persons based on multiple fields.
    * Pros: Convenient if the contact list is very huge and users would like to sort based on multiple fields.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement.
    
### Viewing statistics `stat`

#### Implementation

The Statistics command displays the nationality statistics of a given tutorial group.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Statistics mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `stat T09` command to compute the nationality statistics of tutorial group `T09`.

Step 3. This will call StatisticsCommandParser#parse which will then parse the arguments provided.

Step 4. A new `TutorialGroup` and `StatisticsCommand` object will then be created. It will be used to compute the statistics of the particular `TutorialGroup`. This `TutorialGroup` is then passed to the `StatisticsCommand`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the parser operation works (`NameComparator` not shown):

![StatisticParserSequenceDiagram](images/StatisticParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. `StatisticsCommand#execute` will set the `AddressBook` model's filtered person list with the filter criteria being the tutorial group. It will then be extracted into a `List` and then the `AddressBook` model's list will be reset.

Step 6. A `Statistic` object will then be created and its raw data will be passed to the returned `CommandResult`.

Step 7. The GUI will then proceed to parse the raw data and display it as a pie chart to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Statistic mechanism works:

![StatisticSequenceDiagram](images/StatisticSequenceDiagram.png)

### Importing contacts `import`

#### Implementation

The import JSON file will import an external addressbook and add all the entries to the current addressbook in the user's device.

It works by utilizing the same mechanism that is used by Socius when first initializing the addressbook with existing JSON data.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Import mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `import t35.json` command to import a file located in `data/t35.json`.

Step 3. This will call `ImportCommandParser#parse` which will then parse the argument provided.

Step 4. A new `ImportCommand` object will be created with its `importedFileName` set to the one parsed in the previous step.

Step 5. `ImportCommand#execute` will create a mock `Storage` that takes in a mock `AddressBookStorage` with the `filePath` set to `data/importedFileName`.

Step 6. It will then call `Model#importAddressBook` which will take in the imported `ReadOnlyAddressBook` returned from `Storage#readAddressBook`.

Step 7. Finally, it will return a `CommandResult` if the operation is successful.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: File directory:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow to-be-imported files to be located in the `data` directory
    * Pros: Every file used in the application will live under a single `data` directory.
    * Cons: Less flexibility for the user.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow to-be-imported files to be located anywhere
    * Pros: Gives user the flexibility to put the file wherever they want.
    * Cons: Different OSes have different file paths convention.

### Exporting contacts `export`

#### Implementation

The export JSON file will export all the current data into a JSON file.

It works by utilizing the same mechanism that is used by Socius when saving the addressbook into a JSON file.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Export mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `export tmp.json` command to export a file located in `data/tmp.json`.

Step 3. This will call `ExportCommandParser#parse` which will then parse the argument provided.

Step 4. A new `ExportCommand` object will be created with its `outputFilePath` set to `data/FILE_NAME`,
with the `FILE_NAME` being the string parsed in the previous step.

Step 5. `ExportCommand#execute` will first call `FileUtil#createIfMissing` to create the file as specified in `outputFilePath`.

Step 6. It will then call `JsonUtil#saveJsonFile` which will take in the `outputFilePath` and a `JsonSerializableAddressBook` of the current data, which is retrieved by calling `model#getAddressBook()`.

Step 7. Finally, it will return a `CommandResult` if the operation is successful.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: File directory:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow files to be exported to the `data` directory
    * Pros: Every file exported from the application will live under a single `data` directory.
    * Cons: Less flexibility for the user.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to export files to any directory
    * Pros: Gives user the flexibility to place the file wherever they want.
    * Cons: Different OSes have different file paths convention.

### Aliasing commands `alias`

#### Implementation

The aliasing mechanism will give an alias to the specified command. If an alias already exists, the new command being aliased will overwrite the old one.

During `AliasCommand#execute`, a new entry of alias-command pair will be put into a singleton class called `CommandAliases`, which is implemented using a `HashMap`.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the alias mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `alias a/Singaporeans c/find nat/Singaporean` command to assign the alias `Singaporeans` to the command `find nat/Singaporean`.

Step 2. `AliasCommandParser#parse` will then parse the arguments provided. Then a new `AliasCommand` object will be created after parsing.

The following sequence diagram briefly shows how the alias operation works:

![AliasParserSequenceDiagram](images/AliasParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. `AliasCommand#execute` will then add a new entry of alias-command pair into `CommandAliases` by calling `CommandAliases#put`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the alias command mechanism works:

![AliasSequenceDiagram](images/AliasSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not be saved in the AddressBook, so the person inside the AddressBook will not be updated.
</div>

#### Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Singleton pattern
    * Pros: Cannot be instantiated multiple times.
    * Cons: Might be confusing for new developers.

* **Alternative 2:** Non-Singleton
    * Pros: More commonly used in general and thus easier to understand.
    * Cons: A normal class can be instantiated multiple times, which does not suit the context of this implementation.
    

### Saving data

#### Implementation

After each command, the latest data is saved in a JSON file. This helps users who
wish to seamlessly continue using Socius after exiting from Socius previously.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to safely save data from contact list to a JSON file:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Data is saved after every command.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: More prone to errors since the save file is accessed very frequently and sometimese unnecessarily.

* **Alternative 2:** Data is saved after every command that modifies the contact list.
    * Pros: Less prone to errors since the save file is accessed only when necessary.
    * Cons: Tricky to implement.
    
### Input Suggestion

#### Implementation

The Input Suggestion mechanism will suggest potential words when the user types in something wrong or invalid.

Currently, this feature only supports suggestions for commands and nationalities.

This feature is implemented using the `Wagner-Fischer` dynamic programming algorithm to compute the `Levenshtein distance`.
The `Levenshtein distance` between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits
(insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Input Suggestion mechanism behaves at each step when a user types in a wrong command word.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `fin n/Ben` command, with the intention of typing `find n/Ben`.

Step 3. This will call `AddressBookParser#parseCommand`. But since there are no command words that match it,
it will end up at the `default` clause of the `switch` statement.

Step 4. A new `WordSuggestion` object will be created with its `word` set to the `commandWord`,
`validWords` set to the `COMMAND_WORDS` list, and the `distanceLimit` set to 2.

Step 5. While being initialized, `WordSuggestion#computeAllLevenshteinDistance` will be called, and it will compute the
`Levenshtein distance` of `word` with every single word in `validWords`.
The result will be stored as a `Map` in `editDistances`,
with the key and value being a word and its corresponding edit distance respectively.
the minimum edit distance is also computed and stored in `minDistance`.

Step 6. Next, `WordSuggestion#getSuggestedWords` is called. It will return as a string, all the words that has
the same edit distance as `minDistance`, if `minDistance` is smaller than `distanceLimit`.

Step 7. Finally, it will throw a `ParseException` which contains the suggested words computed previously and
display the suggestions to the user.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Algorithm and Time Complexity:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Dynamic programming (Wagner-Fischer algorithm)
    * Pros: More efficient, only takes `O(n * m)` time, with `n` and `m` being the length of each of the two strings.
    * Cons: Harder to implement by the developers.

* **Alternative 2:** Recursive
    * Pros: Very straightforward to implement as it follows directly from its mathematical formula.
    * Cons: Very inefficient as there are three recursive calls at each step, resulting in exponential time complexity.
