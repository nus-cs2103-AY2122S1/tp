## **Introduction**

Staff’d helps food & beverage managers manage details and schedules of their staff. It is optimized for CLI users so 
that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands. It is optimized for restaurants with two active shifts. 
Please refer to the [_User Guide_](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w11-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) for more information 
about Staff'd.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Overview**

This guide is intended for future developers, current contributors and users. This guide mainly aims to explain the 
implementation of Staff'd to future developers and deepen their knowledge in software development. By the end of this 
guide, you can expect to get an overview of the design architecture of Staff'd and comprehensive details of some of its 
core features, backed up by UML diagrams.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete -i 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<img src="images/WeekShiftsPaneClassDiagram.png" width="300" />

The `Schedule view` subcomponent of the `UI` component meant to facilitate the display of the [schedule view](UserGuide.md#schedule-display),

* displays 2 `SlotCard` for each `DayCard`
* listens to changes in `Model` data to be updated with the modified data

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -i 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -i 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the staff data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list and a `Role` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag and one `Role` object per unique role, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` and `Role` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.png" />

The `Person` subcomponent,

* stores what a `Person` should have, i.e. all `Field` objects and details of employment (e.g. Schedule, dates of being absent).
* does not depend on any of the other three components as it is part of the `Model` component.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

<img src="images/StoragePersonDiagram.png" />

The storage of `Person`,

* can save all the details of a staff in `JsonAdaptedPerson`
* depends on the `Model` component as it is in the `Storage` component



### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Mark/unmark feature

#### Implementation

The mark/unmark feature is facillated by `Person`. It uses the following
operations of `Person`. The marked periods are stored as `Set<Period>` objects.

 * `Person#mark()` — Adds the input time period to the person to be marked as absent. 
 * `Person#unmark()` — Removes the input time period from the person.

These operations make use of `Period#union()` and `Period#complement` and are exposed
by `MarkCommand#execute()` and `RemoveMarkCommand#execute()`.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mark/unmark command
changes the information stored.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The staff all
the staff information is read from the save file `staffd.json`.
The initial information of the staff that we are looking at 
will look something like this. The `Period` object that we are using can be taken to
represent 1/1/2001 to 2/1/2001


![state0](images/MarkState0.png)


Step 2. The user executes the command `mark -i 1 d/2001-01-04`. The `mark` command
calls `ParserUtil#parsePeriod()`, to obtain the time period to mark, and `Person#mark()` to mark this time period on this person. This method uses
`Period#union()` to union the time period with the set.


![state1](images/MarkState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes the command `mark -i 1 d/2001-01-03`. The `mark` command
calls `ParserUtil#parsePeriod()`, to obtain the period to mark as before. As this time period makes the current range, 1/1/2001 to 2/1/2001 and 4/1/2001
become a single range, `Period#union()` that is called, merges the two `Period`
objects into one.


![state2](images/MarkState2.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the mark command works.


![seq](images/MarkSequenceDiagram.png)



The following is an activity diagram showing the general activity of the mark command.

![activity](images/MarkActivityDiagram.png)

The merging of the periods in `mark` command is facilitated by `Period#union()`, which takes
in a collection of Period and performs a mathematical union on the collection, treating the 
collection as a set of dates.
The code is found [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Period.java).

The following is an activity diagram showcasing a simplified view of the activity of the union method.

![activity](images/PeriodUnionActivityDiagram.png)

The `unmark` command does the opposite — it calls `Person#unmark()`, which replaces the
`Period` that are contained in the `Person` with the `Period` objects representing
the initial `Period` without the input `Period`. This command is facilitated by the
`Period#complement()` method which is called on all the stored `Period` objects.






#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to mark attendance**

 * **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Mark absent.
   * Pros: Changes less amount of data in the case of high turnout rate.
   * Cons: Harder to implement features that make use of a staff not being present.
 * **Alternative 2**: Mark present.
   * Pros: Easier to implement other features that make use of a staff being present. 
   * Cons: Changes more data in the case of high turnout rate.

**Aspect: How mark and unmark is represented**

 * **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Stored in the class for a staff.
   * Pros: Easy to implement.
   * Cons: Increased reliance on 
 * **Alternative 2**: Stored in the class representing a shift. 
   * Pros: Easier to implement features related to both shifts and attendance.
   * Cons: More memory intensive.

**Aspect: Representation of a `Period`**

 * **Alternative 1(current implementation):** Use `LocalDate` to represent a period
   * Pros: Makes the command easier to enter. 
   * Cons: Makes shift related features and attendance related features harder to use.
 * **Alternative 2(possible implementation):** Use `LocalDateTime` to represent a period
   * Pros: Makes shift related features easier to implement.
   * Cons: Parser becomes more complicated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Add shift to staff's schedule

#### Implementation

`addShift` is a command for the app to add a shift into a staff's schedule. When the user want to use this command, the
target staff, and the specific shift should be indicated.

The activity diagram of `addShift` command is shown below:

![AddShiftActivity](images/AddShiftActivityDiagram.png)


The add shift functionality is facilitated by  `ModelManager`. It uses the following operation of `ModelManager`.

- `ModelManager#findPersonByName()` — Find the first person with given Name from the address book. If the person is not
  found, null will be returned.

- `ModelManager#addShift()` — Add a shift to the target person's schedule. If that shift has already existed, a
  `DuplicateShiftException` will be thrown.

Also, `AddShiftCommandParser` and `AddShiftCommand` are created to achieve this functionality.

![AddShiftClass](images/AddShiftClassDiagram.png)

The way of implementing `addShift` functionality follows the architecture of the app. Given below is an example usage
scenario and the workflow of the
`addShift` command.

Step 1. The user executes command `addShift -n Steve d/Monday-0`.
`Ui` component reads the command as a string from user's input. After that, `MainWindow`
passes the string to `LogicManager` to manipulate the command.

Step 2. `LogicManager` passes the command to `AddressBookParser` to parse the command. Since the command starts
with `addShift`, a new `AddShiftCommandParser` is created to parse the command further.

Step 3. `AddShiftCommandParser` uses `ArgumentMultimap` to tokenize the prefixes part the command. After extracting the
information the target staff, the shift, and the date, A new
`AddShiftCommand` is created with the information. In this case, the name of the target staff is "Steve", and the
proposed shift is on Monday morning, and the period is seven days starting from the current date when the user runs the
command.

Step 4. `AddShiftCommand` passes the given name to `ModelManager#findPersonByName()`. After finding the specific
staff, `AddShiftCommand` passes the `targetStaff`
`dayOfWeek`, `slot` and `startDate`, `endDate` of the shift to `ModelManager#addShift()`.

Step 5. `Modelmanager#addShift()` updates the schedule of the `targetStaff` with a new `Shift` created with the given
`dayOfWeek`, `slot` and `startDate`, `endDate`.

The sequence diagram of this `addShift` command is shown below:

![AddShiftSequence](images/AddShiftSequenceDiagram.png)


Notes:

1. User can also search the target staff with the staff's index in `lastShownList`
2. A command is considered as a valid `addShift` command if it follows these formats:

- `addShift -n name d/fullDayName-slotNumber`
- `addShift -i index d/fullDayName-slotNumber`

3. `fullDayName` can be any day from "monday" to "sunday". Noticed that it's not case-sensitive.
4. `slotNumber` can only be 0 or 1 currently.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Add the shift to a group of staffs**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Add one by one
    * Pros: Easy to implemented. Decrease the chance to add shift to a wrong person.
    * Cons: Time consuming for user to add one by one.
* **Alternative 2 (proposed implementation):** Add shift to a group of staffs.
    * Pros: Save time for users.
    * Cons: User need to specify the group of staffs before adding shift to their schedules.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Find Staff

#### Implementation

`Find` is a command for the app to search for staff by a specific index or name. When the command is called,
whether it is a search by name or search by index should be indicated with the respective tags `-n` and `-i` along with any additional fields.

The Find functionality is facilitated by  `ModelManager`. It uses the following operation of `ModelManager`.

- `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person)` — Update the filtered list based on the predicate set.
- `ModelManager#getUnFilteredPersonList()`— Retrieve the filtered list of staff

Also, `FindCommandParser` was created to achieve this functionality.

![FindCommand](images/findCommand/FindClassDiagram.png)

The way of implementing `find` functionality follows the architecture of the app. Given below is an example usage
scenarios and the workflow of the `find` command.

Step 1. The user executes command `find -n John`.
`Ui` component reads the command as a string from user's input. After that, `MainWindow`
passes the string to `LogicManager` to manipulate the command.

Step 2. `LogicManager` passes the command to `AddressBookParser` to parse the command. Since the command starts
with `find`, a new `FindCommandParser` is created to parse the command further.

Step 3. `FindCommandParser` determines that the search is by name, due to the `-n` tag. Hence, `FindCommand` is created with the information. In this case, the name of staff to search is "John".

Step 4. `FindCommand` creates a NameContainsKeywordsPredicates object which is then used as a parameter in `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList` to filter the list
for staff whose names match the keywords.

Step 5. Following this, the displayed staff list will display the updated filtered list. 

The sequence diagram of this `Find` command is shown below:

![Find Command Sequence Diagram](images/findCommand/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

The following is an activity diagram showing the general activity of the find command:

![activity](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

Notes:

1. The process is similar for a search by index, but with `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` replaced with `StaffHasCorrectIndexPredicate`
2. A command is considered as a valid `Find` command if it follows these formats:

- `find -n keywords`
- `find -i index`

3. The keywords are not case-sensitive.
4. Index search operates on the filtered list, which is the displayed staff list, and not the overall staff list.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### ViewShift

#### Implementation

`viewShift` is a command for the app to search for the staff working at a specific day and shift. The search is either conducted
by a specific time or by the slot number. When the command is used, whether it is a search by slot number or search by time
should be indicated with the respective tags `-d` and `-ti`.

The activity diagram of `viewShift` command is shown below:

![ViewShiftActivity](images/ViewShiftActivityDiagram.png)

The Find functionality is facilitated by  `ModelManager`. It uses the following operation of `ModelManager`.

- `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person)` — Update the filtered list based on the predicate set.
- `ModelManager#getUnFilteredPersonList()`— Retrieve the filtered list of staff

Also, `FindCommandParser` was created to achieve this functionality.

![ViewShiftCommand](images/viewShiftCommand/ViewShiftClassDiagram.png)

The way of implementing `viewShift` follows the architecture of the app. Given below is an example usage scenarios and the 
workflow of the `find` command.

Step 1. The user executes command `viewShift -ti monday-17:00`.
`Ui` component reads the command as a string from user's input. After that, `MainWindow`
passes the string to `LogicManager` to manipulate the command.

Step 2. `LogicManager` passes the command to `AddressBookParser` to parse the command. Since the command starts
with `viewShift`, a new `ViewShiftCommand` object is created to parse the command further.

Step 3. `ViewShiftCommandParser` determines that the search is by time, due to the `-t` tag. 
Hence, `viewShift` is created with the information. In this case, the day of the week is `MONDAY` and the time is `17:00`.

Step 4. `ViewShiftCommand` creates a PersonIsWorkingPredicate object which is then used as a parameter in `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList` to filter the list
for staff who are working at that particular timing.

Step 5. Following this, the displayed staff list will display the updated filtered list, and the names of those working will
also be outputted on the left of the GUI.

The sequence diagram of this `viewShift` command is shown below:

![ViewShift Command Sequence Diagram](images/viewShiftCommand/ViewShiftSequenceDiagram.png)
![ViewShiftCommand Execution Diagram](images/viewShiftCommand/ViewShiftCommandExecutionSequenceDiagram.png)


Notes:

1. The process is similar for a search by slot number.

2. A command is considered as a valid `viewShift` command if it follows these formats:
- `viewShift -d dayofweek-slotnumber`
- `viewShift -ti dayofweek-time`

3. Note that the `dayofweek` is not case-sensitive, and that time must be inputted in a `HH:mm` format.
4. The viewShift Command operates on the overall staff list and not just the displayed list.
5. Inputting `viewShift` alone also outputs the staff currently working.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Proposed future features** ##

### Operating a command on a group of people together ###

Currently, most of the commands of Staff'd are targeting on a single person, which means user need to specify
the staff's index, name to identify that single staff. In future iterations, we can expand some commands to work on
a group of staff at the same time.

### Make marking absent by time ###

Currently, `mark` functionality can only mark from a start date to an end date, but in reality, it's common that
a staff is only absent a few hours in a day. In future iterations, we can expand the `mark` command to make it available
to make marking absent by time.

### Track salary changes ###

Currently, Staff'd supports calculating a staff's current month salary. In future iterations, we can expand the
functionality to let it track the changes on a staff's salary, store the salary history of a staff.

### Storing both hourly and monthly salary

Currently, Staff'd supports use of hourly salary only. In future iterations, we can expand this functionality
to let it track both hourly and monthly salary. Can be done with the tracking of salary changes.

## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* can type fast
* is tech-savvy
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is a manager of food-chain services
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* has a need to manage staff schedules
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* has a need to manage a significant number of staff

**Value proposition**: It can be complicated and tedious for managers of such food chain services to manually keep track
of their staff information, schedules, working hours, and salaries. Staff’d provides a central management system of
staff that allows for easy and intuitive tracking and handling of the aforementioned data.

## **Appendix C: Effort**

During the V1.2 iteration, we had set out to revamp the entire codebase to accommodate F&B staff and their details as 
compared to regular people. This task was moderately difficult as on one hand, we only had to refactor any instances of 
`person` to `staff` but on the other hand, we had to spend a lot of time implementing and adding fields such as `salary`, 
`schedule`, `role` and `status`. The implementation of `schedule` alone warranted a 4-hour meeting as there was a debate 
on how staff shifts should be stored and how many shifts we would have or even whether we should allow users to choose 
how many shifts they would want in a day and the timing of each shift. This iteration was also the time when we just 
started adding code to the existing codebase and as such, we faced the difficulty of understanding it. Not only did we 
have to understand the code, we had to also understand the abstraction behind the code and adhere to it when adding new 
`person` fields and functions. For all of us, this was the portion that required the most of our effort.

V1.3 was the most difficult and time-consuming iteration. The GUI was one of the hardest parts of this project. Due to 
our unfamiliarity with JavaFX (the library that we used for our GUI), we spent a significant amount of our effort
changing the GUI to fit the staff details, showing the staff schedule and putting it on another tab. From having almost 
zero knowledge about JavaFX to changing the whole GUI was a huge achievement for our team as a whole. Besides that, this 
was the last iteration where we could add new features, so we ramped up the number of commands that we added such as 
`mark`, `swapShift` and `setShiftTime` just to name a few. However, this also led to some unfortunate circumstances. 
By the end of this iteration and subsequent iterations, this led to numerous bugs. A majority of our time was spent on 
fixing these bugs and add comprehensive tests for them.
