## **Design**


### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `SelectedPersonCard`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The `Summary` class displays data on `UI` using the `JavaFX chart` framework.  The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

In particular, interactions on `ContactCard` may load data on  `SelectedContactCard` through `model`.

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data (including Summary).
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Contact` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Contact` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Contact` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Category feature

#### Implementation
The category feature adds to the attributes of the `Contact` object. Similar to the other fields of the `Contact` object,
it can be added and edited by calling the relevant `add` and `edit` commands by using `c/` prefix. It is represented by the `CategoryCode` object.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:
* `isValidCategory()`  —  Determines if the input is a valid category.
* `stringToCategory()`  —  Converts the input into a constant.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The category field is compulsory and requires
one of the available category codes (att, fnb, com, acc, tpt, oth). In the absence or invalidity of the category code,
the contact will not be saved and the user will be prompted to give a valid one.</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how category mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user executes the command `filter c/oth` to filter all "others" category contacts in the address book. And
gets a list of all contacts with the category "others".

Step 2. The user executes the command `edit 1 c/att` which changes the category of the 1st contact from "others" to
"attraction".


The following sequence diagram shows how modifying the category field with `edit` works:
![EditCategoryCodeSequenceDiagram.png](images/EditCategoryCodeSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes the `edit` command with category specified
![EditCategoryActivityDiagram](images/EditCategoryActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How Category is called by the user:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Category field is added through `add` or `edit` commands.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May cause `add` command to be too long.

* **Alternative 2:** Exclusive command to add Category field
  * Pros: Reduces the chance of Feature Overload for `add` and `edit` commands.
  * Cons: Reduces usability due to the need to remember another command.

### Delete Feature

#### Implementation

The Delete feature deletes the specified contact directly from the model, which is reflected on the GUI.
Each Delete operation can either be a deletion based on name or index.
It is implemented with the following operations:

* `DeleteCommandIndex#execute()`
* `DeleteCommandName#execute()`

Given below is an example usage scenario of deleting a contact:

Step 1. The user launches the application. The user executes the command `list` to look at all contacts.

Step 2. The user executes the command `delete 1` to delete the first contact in the List. The `delete` command calls `DeleteCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 3. The `Parser` returns the command result which is then executed by `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Delete operation works to delete a contact (by Index):

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Deleting a contact by name e.g. `delete n/VALID_NAME` results in the Parser returning a different command result:

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagramName.png)

The only difference between the 2 diagrams is the `DeleteCommand` (Name or Index) called and returned to the `Parser` and `LogicManager`.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How Delete is implemented:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete deletes directly from the AddressBook
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Causes other features, such as undo and redo, to be more memory intensive.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete stashes away the contact (for undoing purposes)
    * Pros: More memory friendly, instead of storing a copy of the entire AddressBook.
    * Cons: More complex to implement. Storage of contacts might result in duplicates etc.



### Find feature

#### Implementation

The Find feature works such that it modifies the GUI of the application without modifying any contacts in the list.
It is implemented with the following operation:

* `FindCommand#execute()`  —  Obtains the contacts found to have the specified keyword(s).

The feature makes use of `isFindableContainsKeywordsPredicate`, which represents a boolean-valued function that indicates whether there is any _findable_ property of the contacts that contains the keyword(s) given.
The operation `isFindableContainsKeywordsPredicate#test` returns a boolean that indicates whether a specific contact has a _findable_ property that matches the keyword(s) provided by Tour Guide.

The aforementioned _findable_ properties of the contacts that are checked are as follows:

* name
* phone
* email
* address
* review

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Find feature behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user executes the command `list` to look at all contacts.

Step 2. The user executes the command `find bay ...` to find contacts with properties that contain the keywords *bay*, ...
The `find` command calls `FindCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 3. If user command is in the correct format, a `FindCommand` is created with the list of keywords attached to a `isFindableContainsKeywordPredicate`.
The `FindCommand` will then be executed. Otherwise, no command is executed and a `ParseException` is thrown.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Find operation works to show the relevant contacts:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a Tour Guide executes a new command:

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How Find functions:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays contacts with non-full word matches and searches five properties of a contact.
    * Pros: Shows more contacts as a result of half-matches and more fields.
    * Cons: Less targeted search, more time needed to go through the list of matches.

* **Alternative 2:** Displays contacts with full word matches and only searches the name.
    * Pros: More accurate matches assuming Tour Guide searches for exact keywords.
    * Cons: Less likely to find contacts other than the intended one(s) that might be relevant for a themed or location-based tour itinerary.


### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The filter mechanism works by modifying the GUI of the application to display the contacts in that category without making any changes to the actual contacts stored. The filter implementation makes use of the following operations:

* `Model#updateFilteredContactList()` - iterates through the addressBook. If a `Contact` returns true, the `Contact` is added to the `filteredContacts` list.
* `IsFilterablePredicate()` - returns true if a contact’s `CategoryCode`, `Rating` and `Tag` matches the given filter criteria.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the filter mechanism.

Step 1. The user launched the application for the first time. The `filteredContact` List will be initialized with all contacts in the addressBook `UniqueContactList`.

Step 2. The user executes `filter c/att` command to filter all the attraction contacts in the address book. The `Parser` parses the user input and creates a `FilterCommand`.

Step 3. The filter command creates an IsFilterablePredicate instance with the given CategoryCode, Tag and Rating parameters and calls Model#updateFilteredContactList() with the predicate as an argument, causing the filteredContact List to be modified to contain only attraction contacts in the address book.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new valid filter command:

![FilterActivityDiagram](images/FilterActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Functionality of Filter feature**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filters by multiple parameters (`CategoryCode`, `Tag`, and `Rating`).
    * Pros: More flexible usage as users can choose to enter one or more criteria.
    * Cons: Parser and filtering logic implemented may be more complicated as there are more cases to handle (e.g. multiple tags and a rating entered, a category code and a tag entered, etc)

* **Alternative 2:** Only handles filter by one parameter (e.g. `CategoryCode` only).
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Does not allow user to get more specific filter results.

### View feature

#### Implementation

The view mechanism works by modifying the GUI of the application to display the details of the selected contact in the Display Pane. The view implementation makes use of `Model#getFilteredContactList()` which returns the list of contacts currently displayed to the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the view mechanism.

Step 1. The user launched the application for the first time. The `filteredContact` List will be initialized with all contacts in the addressBook `UniqueContactList`.

Step 2. The user executes `view n/Marina Bay Sands` command to display the contact details of Marina Bay Sands. The `Parser` parses user input and creates a `ViewCommandName`.

Step 3. The view command calls the `Model#getFilteredContactList()` and iterates through the list to check for a matching contact Name. If the contact is successfully retrieved, the Display Pane updates with details of "Marina Bay Sands".

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works:

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Functionality of View feature**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow users to view contacts in the currently displayed list.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Less flexibility for users as they are limited to contacts in the displayed list. They need to execute `list` to be able to view any contact in the address book.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to view any contact in the address book even if it is not shown in the current list.
    * Pros: More flexibility for users.
    * Cons: More difficult to implement. Additionally, it is impossible to view a contact not displayed in the list by index. Hence, `ViewCommandIndex` will be limited to the displayed contacts, while `ViewCommandName` will allow users to view any contact in the address book.

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The Sort feature modifies the internal contact list stored in the addressbook according to the preference of sorting.
It is implemented with the following operations:

* `SortCommandName#execute()`  —  Sorts the contacts in the list based on name in lexicographical order.
* `SortCommandRating#execute()`  —  Sorts the contacts in the list based on rating in descending order.

These operations make use of the operation `Model#sortList(String sortBy)`, which calls `AddressBook#sortList(String sortBy)`
to change the order of the contacts in the contact list. In this way, the user's sorting preference is saved.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Sort feature behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user executes the command `list` to look at all contacts.

Step 2. The user executes the command `filter c/att` to filter all the attraction contacts in the addressbook.

Step 3. The user executes the command `sort rating` to display the attraction contacts based on rating in descending order.
Since user command is in the correct format, a `SortCommand` is created. Otherwise, no command is executed and a `ParseException` is thrown.

Step 4. The `sort` command calls `Model#sortList()` with the String `"rating"` as an argument,
causing the internal contact list to be sorted accordingly.


The following sequence diagram shows how the Sort operation works to show the relevant contacts:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new Sort command:

![SortActivityDiagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How Sort is implemented:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts the internal list of the addressbook.
    * Pros: Sorting preference is saved internally, so any command linked to the ordering of the contact list is applicable.
    * Cons: User is not able to display contacts based on recently added contacts once the contact list is sorted.

* **Alternative 2:** Modifies the GUI to display the sorted contacts without making any changes to the actual list saved in the addressbook.
    * Pros: No change to the data saved is required, therefore fewer method calls.
    * Cons: Commands such as `edit INDEX` and `view INDEX` may not work in conjunction with `sort` as the sorting is only implemented in the UI
    instead of the `filteredContacts`, which depends on the internal list of the addressbook.


### Ratings feature

#### Implementation

The Ratings feature is implemented as an additional field in the `Contact` object. Similar to the other fields in the `Contact` object, the `rating` field is implemented with the following two operations:

* `AddCommand#execute()` —  Optionally initialises rating of contact added.
* `EditCommand#execute()` —  Optionally modifies rating of contact added.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The ratings field is not compulsory. If the `add` command is used without specifying a rating for the new contact, the contact will be 'unrated' and assigned a default value of 0. Similarly, when a contact's rating is cleared using `edit` command, it is also assigned a default value of 0.

</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the rating mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. For each contact, the `ContactCard` object is constructed with rating as one of the fields.

Step 2. The user executes `add ... ra/3` to add a new contact. The `add` command calls `ParserUtil#ParseRating()`, creating a `Rating` object if a valid input rating is received.

Step 3. The user executes `edit 1 ... ra/5` to update the 1st contact's rating. The `edit` command calls `ParserUtil#ParseRating()`, creating a `Rating` object if a valid input rating is received.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the input rating is invalid (i.e. a non-integer or outside of the range 1 to 5), the parsers use `Rating#isValidRating()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the modification on rating.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how ratings are modified using `add` command:

![RatingSequenceDiagram.png](images/RatingSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `add` command with rating specified:

![img.png](images/RatingActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How user modifies rating field:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** As a field written by `AddCommand` and `EditCommand`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Rating a contact is less straightforward.
      Ratings do not stand out among another features.

* **Alternative 2:** As an individual command `RateCommand`.
    * Pros: Dedicated all-in-one feature for ratings, easy modification.
    * Cons: Duplicates functionality of `AddCommand` and `EditCommand`, not particularly essential.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by the `List<ReadOnlyAddressBook>` in Model Manager which stores a version of the address book every time changes are made and `current` which keeps track of the index of the current address book in the list. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Model#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `Model#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `Model#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The history list will be initialized with the initial address book state as its only element, and the `current` index set to zero.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th contact in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commit()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the history List, and `current` is incremented by 1 (to the index of newly inserted address book state).

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Marina Bay Sands …​` to add a new contact. The `add` command also calls `Model#commit()`, causing another modified address book to be saved into the his tory list amd `current` to be incremented by 1.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the history List.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will decrement `current` index by one, to the index of the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `current` index is 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#isUndoable()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redo()`, which increments the `currentStatePointer` by 1 (to the previously undone state), and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `current` index is `history.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#isRedoable()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the history List remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commit()`. Since `current` is not set to the index of the last element in the list, all address book states after the `current` index will be purged.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a command that changes the data stored in the address book:

![img.png](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the contact being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Review Feature

#### Implementation

The review feature builds upon the `Contact` class by adding more functionality to the class. It utilises the `rv/` tag in the `add` command to add a review stored internally as a `Review` object.
It implements the following operations:
* `isValidReview()`  — Determines if the input value is valid.
* `isEmptyReview()`  — Determines if the stored Review is empty (stored as `-No Review-` String).

In addition, numerous classes had to be updated to accommodate the Review feature:
* `AddCommandParser` to parse the new `rv/` tag.
* `ParserUtil` to parse the Review content.
* `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser` to enable editing of Reviews.

Given below is an example usage scenario of adding a Review:

Step 1. The user adds a new Review using the `add` command e.g. `add n/test e/test@gmail.com p/12344321 a/test c/att rv/test review`.

Step 2. The `add` command calls `ParserUtil#ParseReview()`, creating a `Review` object.

The following sequence diagram gives the overview of the add command with a review:

![Sequence Diagram for Review](images/ReviewSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows how the review operation works:

![Activity Diagram for Review](images/ReviewActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How Review is called by the user:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Adds a review through the `add` command or `edit` command.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Add command or edit command can become very lengthy.

* **Alternative 2:** Separate command for review
    * Pros: Increases modularity by making review an entirely new command.
    * Cons: Too many commands which may confuse the User.


### Summary Feature

#### Implementation

The `Summary` class summarises the contents of the entire `AddressBook`. It utilises the `AddressBook` class to
obtain a read-only copy of `AddressBook` to summarise the data within. It implements the following operations:
* `setNumberOfContacts()`  — Calculates and sets the number of contacts in the addressbook.
* `setPercentageRatings()`  — Calculates and sets the percentage of contacts that have a rating (unrated not included).
* `setNumberCategory()`  — Calculates and sets the number of contacts in each category defined by `CatergoryCode`.
* `getNumberOfContactsGui()`  — Returns the total number of contacts to display on the GUI.
* `getPercentageRatingsGui()`  — Returns the Pie Chart data for the proportions/percentage for `Rating`.
* `getPercentageCategoryGui()`  — Returns the Pie Chart data for the proportions/percentage for `CatergoryCode`.


Additionally, `Summary` will communicate with `Ui`, specifically `MainWindow` to display the summarised results.

The following sequence diagram gives an overview of how `Summary` works when the app launches:

![Sequence Diagram for Summary](images/SummarySequenceDiagram.png)

`Summary` updates when certain commands are executed. These commands include:
1. Add
2. Clear
3. Delete
4. Filter
5. Find
6. List
7. Undo
8. Redo
9. Summary

The following sequence diagram shows how `Summary` updates when these commands are executed:

![Sequence Diagram for Summary Commands](images/SummarySequenceDiagramCommand.png)


The above sequence diagrams describe how Summary pulls data from `AddressBook` to summarise data.
`Summary` uses `JavaFx chart` to display data, on top of the text.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How Summary summarises data from the internal AddressBook:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Works on a Read-Only copy of `AddressBook`.
    * Pros: Easier to implement, guaranteed to not edit the internals.
    * Cons: Works directly with a Read-Only copy of `AddressBook`.

* **Alternative 2:** Gets data directly from `Contact`, `Review` etc.
    * Pros: Data is kept directly with the low-level classes and pulled from there.
    * Cons: Extremely complex, especially after user adds, deletes or edits a contact.

### Export Feature

#### Implementation

The Export feature works such that it export the contacts specified into a text file, without modifying any contacts in the list.
It is implemented with the following operation:

* `ExportCommandIndex#execute()`  —  Exports the contacts at the specified index in the current list.
* `ExportCommandAll#execute()`  —  Exports all the contacts in the current list.

The feature makes use of an `ExportStorage` class, which handles the manipulation of the aforementioned exported text file. It is implemented inside the Storage component and is implemented using a singleton design pattern. This class has an `addToStorage` write method which is called by the `exportContact()` method in the read-only `AddressBook` model.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Export feature behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user executes the command `list` to look at all contacts.

Step 2. The user executes the command `export 1` to export the contact at index 1 in the list.
The `export` command calls `ExportCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 3. If the index is not out of range for the list (i.e. the list has a contact at index 1), an `ExportCommandIndex` is created by `ExportCommandParser#parse()` instead of an `ExportCommandAll`, as the command has specified a valid index.

Step 4. The `ExportCommandIndex` will then be executed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Export operation works to export all filtered contacts:

![Sequence Diagram for Export](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a Tour Guide executes a new export command to export a single contact:

![Activity Diagram for Export](images/ExportActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How Export retrieves data from the internal AddressBook**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Works on a Read-Only copy of `AddressBook`.
    * Pros: Easier to implement, guaranteed to not edit the internals.
    * Cons: Exposing internal workings of `AddressBook`.

* **Alternative 2:** Gets data directly from `Contact`.
    * Pros: Data is kept directly with the low-level classes and pulled from there.
    * Cons: Extremely complex, especially after user adds, deletes or edits a contact.

**Aspect: How `ExportCommand` exports a single contact vs. all contacts**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `ExportCommand` is abstracted into `ExportCommandAll` and `ExportCommandIndex` for single export vs. collective export respectively.
    * Pros: Easier to understand, hides the loop of exporting contacts away from the `Parser`, inside the implementation of `ExportCommandAll`.
    * Cons: Creates two additional command classes

* **Alternative 2:** Single `ExportCommand` takes an index as argument and is repeatedly called for exporting all contacts
    * Pros: All export commands are handled in one class.
    * Cons: The one ExportCommandParser will be extremely complex, has to handle parsing as well as recursively calling another `ExportCommand` for each index.

### Navigating Input History Feature

#### Implementation
The navigating input history feature works by storing an arraylist within the class `InputHistory` which stores and retrieves string commands. It is implemented with the following operations:
* `getInstance()`  — Retrieves the singleton object InputHistory.
* `addToHistory(String inputCommand)`  — Adds the string "inputCommand" into the list containing all past commands.
* `resetRecentIndex()`  — Resets the position of the pointer(determining current command in the array) to the size of the array.
* `getPreviousInput()`  — Gets the previous input based on the current pointer in the class `InputHistory`
* `getNextInput()`  — Gets the next input based on the current pointer in the class `InputHistory`
* `isNotLeastRecentInput()`  — Used to determine if pointer within the class `InputHistory` is not pointing to the last item within its list storing previous commands.
* `isNotMostRecentInput()`  — Used to determine if pointer within the class `InputHistory` is not pointing to the first item within its list storing previous commands.

`InputHistory` class will communicate with the class `CommandBox` to display the requested commands.

The following activity diagrams gives an overview of how `InputHistory` works when the user presses the up and down arrow keys to navigate through their input history:

![Activity Diagram for Up_Arrow](images/InputHistoryUpArrowActivityDiagram.png)
![Activity Diagram for Down_Arrow](images/InputHistoryDownArrowActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How `InputHistory` is created and accessed.**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Adopt the Singleton pattern as the design pattern for `InputHistory`
* Pros: Provides an easy way to access `InputHistory` from anywhere in the code and enforces having only one `InputHistory` object.
* Cons: Harder to test since Singleton objects carry data from one test to another.

**Alternative 2:** Create the `InputHistory` object the upon initiation of WhereTourGo and save that object within the `CommandBox`.
* Pros: Relatively easy to test
* Cons: Higher chances of bugs due to having no limitation on the number of `InputHistory` objects

## **Appendix: Effort**

Overall, we estimate putting in 20% more effort than the original AB3 implementation in developing WhereTourGo. This is because we more or less doubled the number of features in WhereTourGo, and also augmented several of the current features. 

Additionally, the features we implemented were not novel and required modifications of the internals in AB3. Since certain features relied on one another, such as Ui and Summary, it proved to be a challenge modifying these features in tandem and ensuring they work well together.

Throughout the process of our development, we were not able to find and use any libraries to cut down on our effort either.

Some difficulties encountered in our project are elaborated upon below:

* `filter`: Implementation logic was complex as we had many cases to consider due to the many parameters (e.g. one category code and multiple tags, multiple category codes and rating provided).


* `sum`: Summary required interfacing with all the different components (especially commands) in the app in order to summarise the data. Additionally, it needed to sync with the UI and refresh whenever there were updates.


* `view`: Displaying different types of info in the display pane proved to be a challenge, it involved hiding the summary when displaying person and vice versa.


* `sort`: Implementation required a rather different approach from Filter and Find, which only dealt with the read-only and filterable contact list. Our implementation involves making changes to the actual list saved and adapting to the current codebase instead of simply editing the GUI logic. This is so that the Sort command, as a new command, complements the other modification-based commands (e.g. Edit and Delete), and users are able to modify contacts based on the displayed list.


* `undo`/`redo`: Required a significant change to the Model as we had to add a List<ReadOnlyAddressBook> to store the states of the address book and a current index to keep track of the current address book. Additionally, we had to make sure that the Undo/Redo implementation supports all commands.


* `export`: Required creating a new class in Storage which had to be initialised and called carefully from the right classes to prevent breaking OOP barriers.


* `Rating` field: Making this field optional posed a problem in terms of initialising the empty rating for contacts without this field, as well as displaying this in the UI. More crucially, this implementation also needed to be suited for evaluation of the rating value, which affected other methods like `filter` and `sort`.


* Input history navigation: Design pattern had to be carefully considered as it was crucial in ensuring that there were no duplicates in the object that was managing the saved commands. Our implementation was based on the Singleton pattern whereby only a single instance of the class is present during the execution of our program.
  Extensive testing also had to be done due to the potential to have many off-by-one errors to ensure that the feature was functioning according to plan.
