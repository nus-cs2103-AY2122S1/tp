# Academy Directory

### Introduction

* Academy Directory (AD) is a desktop appplication for CS1101S tutors (or Avengers) to manage studentsâ€™ personal
  contact, grades, tutorial attendance, and assignment completion, as well as visualizing and manipulating statistics for tutoring purposes.
  It is optimized primarily for usage in teaching CS1101S - Programming Methodology I - at the National University of Singapore.<br>
  
Point of View: You are an Avenger sitting behind the control table, supervising your students through the transparent glass while physically interacting with the system to manage your tutee's grades and participation.

Don't get us wrong though. We are not mad space scientists doing controlled experiment on students. *Or are we?...*
