* TeachBook is a desktop app for primary and secondary school teachers to manage student contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is targeted towards teachers who can type fast. It allows teachers to store and organise contacts related to their students into different classes. On top of that, teachers can tag the class role of the student.
* The project extends from an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook Level 3_) used for managing contact details which was created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TeachBook Product Website](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w10-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the AY2122S1-CS2103T-W10-2 Developers** initiative.
