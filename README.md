# PlannerMD

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

* PlannerMD is an all-in-one desktop application to help clinic receptionists manage patients and appointments in a clinic.
* PlannerMD helps clinic receptionists seamlessly integrate the daily doctor appointments and the unique requirements of each patient into a single application.
* PlannerMD also expedites the manual processes found in a clinic and saves the receptionists plenty of time while reducing human error.
* PlannerMD is designed primarily for advanced computer users who prefer typing over using a mouse as most user interactions happen through a Command Line Interface (CLI).
