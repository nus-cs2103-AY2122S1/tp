[![CI Status](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/actions)

**Source Control** is a desktop app for CS1101S professors to manage the performance of their students.

This application allows you to **store comprehensive data** of each student quickly, and allows you to search through them easily. With Source Control, you will never have to worry about your large student cohort and tracking numerous assessments!

Source Control can also give you both a quick overview and a closer look of how your students are performing. This application **provides in-depth data analysis** of the performance of your students in each assessment, giving you timely feedback on the pace and difficulty level of the module.

Source Control is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Source Control can help you track your studentsâ€™ performance faster than traditional GUI apps!
