# CallMeMaybe
___
* This is **a project by Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application _designed for freelance telemarketers_ who need an easy to way to catalog their contacts.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **decent level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `CallMeMaybe` because it tracks who have been called in the huge list of people to call.
* Check out the documentation at our [website](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t13-4.github.io/tp/)!
