# PropertyWhiz

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

* This is a desktop application for property agents who wish to manage their work.
  * Tracks properties
  * Tracks prospective buyers
  * Matches properties and buyers
* It is named `PropertyWhiz` as we believe property agents using this application will become "whizzes" in their field.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Property Whiz Website](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w11-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
