# SeniorLove

[![CI Status](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-1/tp/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

A contact management desktop application which aims to facilitate community workers' visits to the elderly. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Senior Love can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* This is **a course project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _SeniorLove_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `SeniorLove` (`SL` for short) because it was created for community service staff working with seniors.
