DukePro(f) is a schedule-planning desktop application that assists **university professors** in managing 
their **consultations**. Amidst long hours of lectures and tutorials in the week, professors may still 
need to cater timeslots for **student consultations**, which can be hard to come by and difficult to keep 
track of. 

It is named `DukePro(f)` (Duke-Professor) because our project's target audience is professors, and it is also a nod 
to our CS2103T iP (individual Project), which was named `Duke`.

# Usage

<hr />

With DukePro(f), professors will be able to:

* Add, edit, and delete your consultations
* List all of your consultations, or just your next consultation
* List your free time slots for consultation booking
* Block certain time slots to ensure your consultations don't clash with other commitments
* List all of the time slots that you've blocked so far
* And many more!
