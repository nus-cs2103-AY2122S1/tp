* **Sellah** is an address book containing the contact information and orders related to the clients and partners. The information and status of each order can also be easily monitored by the user. This product makes it easy and convenient to track orders and look for future cooperation.
* This product is for online sellers on e-commerce platforms who prefer CLI over GUI. These sellers have a large client base, so they need to keep track of the manufacturing and delivery of their products as well as the contact information of their customers and business partners with the help of **Sellah**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
