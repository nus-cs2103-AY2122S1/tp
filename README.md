* This is **a project for NUS School of Computing students** from CS2103 module (AY2122S1-CS2103-F09-1).<br>
* This desktop application is used for **NUS Teaching Assistant** to keep track the modules they teach and the status of students enrolled in the specific modules.
* It is named `Teaching Assistant’s Buddy (TAB)` (`TAB` for short).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Teaching Assistant’s Buddy Product Website](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-f09-1.github.io/tp/)**.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Lowercase letter(s) followed by a slash are prefixes that prefix a parameter, to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add module m/<module name>`, `m/` is a prefix that prefixes the `<module name>` parameter.

* Words in `<angle brackets>` are the parameters prefixed by prefixes, to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add module m/<module name>`, `<module name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add module m/CS2105`.

* Parameters must be prefixed with their specific prefixes.<br>
  e.g. the command `add module m/CS2105` will add the module CS2105 to TAB, where the commands `add module i/CS2105` and `add module CS2105` will not work.

* Parameters must only contain permitted characters, as listed in the [Parameter summary](#parameter-summary-with-prefix-included) below.

* Optional parameters are denoted in this user guide using square brackets '[]', at least one optional parameter must be present when executing a command.<br>
  e.g. in `edit task m/<module name> ti/<task id> [a/<edited task name>] [d/<edited task deadline>]`, `a/<edited task name>` and `d/<edited task deadline>` are the optional parameters

* If duplicate parameters are provided, only the latest parameters will be processed.

* Students in different modules with the same student id are treated as different students.

* Tasks can be added to modules without students, but will only become visible after students have been added to the module.
