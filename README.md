This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).<br/>
The project is a desktop application (called Trace2Gather) used for managing a hotel,
for ease of tracking guests and rooms status for contact tracing.<br/>
For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t13-3.github.io/tp/)**.
