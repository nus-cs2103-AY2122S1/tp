Busy private 1-to-1 home tutors can find it difficult to remember all their students' information.<br>
**Tuition Address Book (TAB)** is an all-in-one desktop application that helps keep track of large amounts of student and lesson information, to empower tutors to provide the best quality home tuition service.<br>
TAB comes with a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) while optimised for user interaction via a CLI (Command Line Interface). Use TAB to effortlessly manage customer contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app!
