### **Staff'd**

**Introduction**

This is project by Software Engineering students.

It is targeted towards tech-savvy managers of food chain services who want to manage their staff.

This is because it can be complicated and tedious for managers of such food chain services to manually keep track of their staff information, schedules, working hours, and salaries. Staffâ€™d provides a central management system of staff that allows for easy and intuitive tracking and handling of the aforementioned data.

**Example usages:**
  * as a manager, you can add, delete, view, and edit staff information (including their schedules!) easily through Command Line Interface (CLI)
  * view the weekly schedule of a staff, or even view the overall weekly schedule
  * as a manager, you can automatically calculate their salary and view the salary report
  * additionally, you can find and view the information of any staff easily by searching up their name, staff ID, or even index in the staff list generated

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
