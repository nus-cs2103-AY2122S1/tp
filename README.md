**Spam is a desktop app for managing contacts** targeted at marketers who require fast manipulation and precise handling of contact data. It enables marketers to more easily manage and make use of email and phone leads, and minimise tedious and repetitive tasks such as data entry, email blasts, and mail merge.

- If you are interested in using Spam, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w13-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
- If you are interested about developing Spam, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-w13-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
