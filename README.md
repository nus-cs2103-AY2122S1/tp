ThunderCat (TC) is a desktop app designed for Year 2 Computing Students. You can manage contacts, organise them into project groups and manage your tasks according to the groups. The application is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ThunderCat can get your project groups' management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
