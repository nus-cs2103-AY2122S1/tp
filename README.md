## What is gitGud?

gitGud is a **desktop application for storing and managing your friends' gaming information and schedules**.

However, with gitGud, there is no need to get tilted (frustrated) by this anymore as gitGud provides you with a convenient
platform to manage essential gaming information of your fellow gamer friends.

For example, to get you excited, gitGud supports many time-saving features such as finding friends available to play with
just a single command.
