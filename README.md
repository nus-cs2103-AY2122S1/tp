* This is **ContactSh**, a **CLI-based contacts manager for NUS Student Entrepreneurs proficient in Unix CLI**.<br>
  Benefits:
  * users familiar with Unix commands can quickly master using the app efficiently
  * keeps track of tasks/meetings associated with contacts
  * enhanced contact searchability and organisation
  * eliminates the need to remember and recall interpersonal details of contacts
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `ContactSh` (`Contacts`+`Shell`) because it was created as a contact management software designed with common Shell interfaces in mind.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ContactSh Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
