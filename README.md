# SOCIUS

Socius is a simple desktop app for managing CS2103T tutorial classmatesâ€™ contacts for
CS2103T module-takers, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

If you can type fast, Socius can get your contact management tasks done faster than
traditional GUI apps.
